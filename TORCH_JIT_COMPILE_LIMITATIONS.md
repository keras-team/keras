# Torch Backend jit_compile Limitations

## Issue #21647: jit_compile=True with EfficientNetV2 on torch backend

### Problem
When using `jit_compile=True` with certain Keras models (especially EfficientNetV2) on the torch backend, you may encounter `InternalTorchDynamoError` or `RuntimeError` related to torch.compile being unable to trace optree operations.

### Root Cause
Keras uses tree operations (from optree or torch._pytree) for handling nested structures. When `jit_compile=True` is enabled, PyTorch's torch.compile attempts to trace through all Python operations, including these tree utilities. However, torch.compile has limitations with certain C/C++ extensions and symbolic operations.

### Error Messages
- **GPU**: `InternalTorchDynamoError: TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'NoneType' and 'int'`
- **CPU**: `RuntimeError: TypeError: cannot determine truth value of Relational`

### Workarounds

#### Option 1: Disable JIT Compilation (Recommended)
```python
model.compile(
    optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.001),
    loss=CategoricalCrossentropy(),
    metrics=['accuracy'],
    jit_compile=False  # or omit this parameter
)
```

#### Option 2: Use a Different Backend
Switch to TensorFlow or JAX backend which have better jit_compile support:
```python
import os
os.environ["KERAS_BACKEND"] = "tensorflow"  # or "jax"
```

#### Option 3: Use Fixed Input Shapes
If you must use jit_compile with torch, ensure all input shapes are fixed (no None dimensions):
```python
base_model = EfficientNetV2B2(
    include_top=False,
    input_shape=(224, 224, 3),  # Fixed shape, no None
    pooling='avg',
    weights=None
)
```

### Status
This is a known limitation of torch.compile when working with complex nested structures. The PyTorch team is aware of limitations with certain patterns and continues to improve torch.compile support.

### Future Improvements
Potential solutions being explored:
1. Add torch.compile skip decorators for tree operations
2. Use torch.compiler.disable() context for specific operations
3. Refactor to use pure torch operations where possible
