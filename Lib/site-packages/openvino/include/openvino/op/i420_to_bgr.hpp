/// \brief Color conversion operation from I420 to BGR format.
///    Input:
///        - Input NV12 image can be represented in two ways:
///            a) Single plane (as it is in the file): I420 height dimension is 1.5x bigger than image height. 'C'
///               dimension shall be 1.
///            b) Three separate planes (used this way in many physical video sources): Y, U and V. In
///               this case
///               b1) Y plane has height same as image height. 'C' dimension equals to 1
///               b2) U plane has dimensions: 'H' = image_h / 2; 'W' = image_w / 2; 'C' = 1.
///               b3) V plane has dimensions: 'H' = image_h / 2; 'W' = image_w / 2; 'C' = 1.
///        - Supported element types: u8 or any supported floating-point type.
///    Output:
///        - Output node will have NHWC layout and shape HxW same as image spatial dimensions.
///        - Number of output channels 'C' will be 3, as per interleaved BGR format, first channel is B, last is R
///
/// \details Conversion of each pixel from I420 (YUV) to RGB space is represented by following formulas:
///        R = 1.164 * (Y - 16) + 1.596 * (V - 128)
///        G = 1.164 * (Y - 16) - 0.813 * (V - 128) - 0.391 * (U - 128)
///        B = 1.164 * (Y - 16) + 2.018 * (U - 128)
///        Then R, G, B values are clipped to range (0, 255)
