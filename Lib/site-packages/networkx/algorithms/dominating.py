    r"""Finds a dominating set for the graph G.

    A *dominating set* for a graph with node set *V* is a subset *D* of
    *V* such that every node not in *D* is adjacent to at least one
    member of *D* [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    start_with : node (default=None)
        Node to use as a starting point for the algorithm.

    Returns
    -------
    D : set
        A dominating set for G.

    Notes
    -----
    This function is an implementation of algorithm 7 in [2]_ which
    finds some dominating set, not necessarily the smallest one.
