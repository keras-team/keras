    A minimum spanning tree is a subgraph of the graph (a tree)
    with the minimum sum of edge weights.  A spanning forest is a
    union of the spanning trees for each connected component of the graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : undirected Graph
       An undirected graph. If `G` is connected, then the algorithm finds a
       spanning tree. Otherwise, a spanning forest is found.

    algorithm : string
       The algorithm to use when finding a minimum spanning tree. Valid
       choices are 'kruskal', 'prim', or 'boruvka'. The default is 'kruskal'.

    weight : string
       Edge data key to use for weight (default 'weight').

    keys : bool
       Whether to yield edge key in multigraphs in addition to the edge.
       If `G` is not a multigraph, this is ignored.

    data : bool, optional
       If True yield the edge data along with the edge.

    ignore_nan : bool (default: False)
        If a NaN is found as an edge weight normally an exception is raised.
        If `ignore_nan is True` then that edge is ignored instead.

    Returns
    -------
    edges : iterator
       An iterator over edges in a maximum spanning tree of `G`.
       Edges connecting nodes `u` and `v` are represented as tuples:
       `(u, v, k, d)` or `(u, v, k)` or `(u, v, d)` or `(u, v)`

       If `G` is a multigraph, `keys` indicates whether the edge key `k` will
       be reported in the third position in the edge tuple. `data` indicates
       whether the edge datadict `d` will appear at the end of the edge tuple.

       If `G` is not a multigraph, the tuples are `(u, v, d)` if `data` is True
       or `(u, v)` if `data` is False.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from networkx.algorithms import tree

    Find minimum spanning edges by Kruskal's algorithm

    >>> G = nx.cycle_graph(4)
    >>> G.add_edge(0, 3, weight=2)
    >>> mst = tree.minimum_spanning_edges(G, algorithm="kruskal", data=False)
    >>> edgelist = list(mst)
    >>> sorted(sorted(e) for e in edgelist)
    [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3]]

    Find minimum spanning edges by Prim's algorithm

    >>> G = nx.cycle_graph(4)
    >>> G.add_edge(0, 3, weight=2)

    >>> sorted(sorted(e) for e in edgelist)
    [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3]]

    Notes
    -----
    For Bor≈Øvka's algorithm, each edge must have a weight attribute, and
    each edge weight must be distinct.

    For the other algorithms, if the graph edges do not have a weight
    attribute a default weight of 1 will be used.

    Sample a random spanning tree using the edges weights of `G`.

    This function supports two different methods for determining the
    probability of the graph. If ``multiplicative=True``, the probability
    is based on the product of edge weights, and if ``multiplicative=False``
    it is based on the sum of the edge weight. However, since it is
    easier to determine the total weight of all spanning trees for the
    multiplicative version, that is significantly faster and should be used if
    possible. Additionally, setting `weight` to `None` will cause a spanning tree
    to be selected with uniform probability.

    The function uses algorithm A8 in [1]_ .

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : nx.Graph
        An undirected version of the original graph.

    weight : string
        The edge key for the edge attribute holding edge weight.

    multiplicative : bool, default=True
        If `True`, the probability of each tree is the product of its edge weight
        over the sum of the product of all the spanning trees in the graph. If
        `False`, the probability is the sum of its edge weight over the sum of
        the sum of weights for all spanning trees in the graph.

def number_of_spanning_trees(G, *, root=None, weight=None):
    """Returns the number of spanning trees in `G`.

    A spanning tree for an undirected graph is a tree that connects
    all nodes in the graph. For a directed graph, the analog of a
    spanning tree is called a (spanning) arborescence. The arborescence
    includes a unique directed path from the `root` node to each other node.
    The graph must be weakly connected, and the root must be a node
    that includes all nodes as successors [3]_. Note that to avoid
    discussing sink-roots and reverse-arborescences, we have reversed
    the edge orientation from [3]_ and use the in-degree laplacian.

    This function (when `weight` is `None`) returns the number of
    spanning trees for an undirected graph and the number of
    arborescences from a single root node for a directed graph.
    When `weight` is the name of an edge attribute which holds the
    weight value of each edge, the function returns the sum over
    all trees of the multiplicative weight of each tree. That is,
    the weight of the tree is the product of its edge weights.

    Kirchoff's Tree Matrix Theorem states that any cofactor of the
    Laplacian matrix of a graph is the number of spanning trees in the
    graph. (Here we use cofactors for a diagonal entry so that the
    cofactor becomes the determinant of the matrix with one row
    and its matching column removed.) For a weighted Laplacian matrix,
    the cofactor is the sum across all spanning trees of the
    multiplicative weight of each tree. That is, the weight of each
    tree is the product of its edge weights. The theorem is also
    known as Kirchhoff's theorem [1]_ and the Matrix-Tree theorem [2]_.

    For directed graphs, a similar theorem (Tutte's Theorem) holds with
    the cofactor chosen to be the one with row and column removed that
    correspond to the root. The cofactor is the number of arborescences
    with the specified node as root. And the weighted version gives the
    sum of the arborescence weights with root `root`. The arborescence
    weight is the product of its edge weights.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    root : node
       A node in the directed graph `G` that has all nodes as descendants.
       (This is ignored for undirected graphs.)

    weight : string or None, optional (default=None)
        The name of the edge attribute holding the edge weight.
        If `None`, then each edge is assumed to have a weight of 1.

    Returns
    -------
    Number
        Undirected graphs:
            The number of spanning trees of the graph `G`.
            Or the sum of all spanning tree weights of the graph `G`
            where the weight of a tree is the product of its edge weights.
        Directed graphs:
            The number of arborescences of `G` rooted at node `root`.
            Or the sum of all arborescence weights of the graph `G` with
            specified root where the weight of an arborescence is the product
            of its edge weights.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXPointlessConcept
        If `G` does not contain any nodes.

    NetworkXError
        If the graph `G` is directed and the root node
        is not specified or is not in G.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.complete_graph(5)
    >>> round(nx.number_of_spanning_trees(G))
    125

    >>> G = nx.Graph()
    >>> G.add_edge(1, 2, weight=2)
    >>> G.add_edge(1, 3, weight=1)
    >>> G.add_edge(2, 3, weight=1)
    >>> round(nx.number_of_spanning_trees(G, weight="weight"))
    5

    Notes
    -----
    Self-loops are excluded. Multi-edges are contracted in one edge
    equal to the sum of the weights.
