def node_redundancy(G, nodes=None):
    r"""Computes the node redundancy coefficients for the nodes in the bipartite
    graph `G`.

    The redundancy coefficient of a node `v` is the fraction of pairs of
    neighbors of `v` that are both linked to other nodes. In a one-mode
    projection these nodes would be linked together even if `v` were
    not there.

    More formally, for any vertex `v`, the *redundancy coefficient of `v`* is
    defined by

    .. math::

        rc(v) = \frac{|\{\{u, w\} \subseteq N(v),
        \: \exists v' \neq  v,\: (v',u) \in E\:
        \mathrm{and}\: (v',w) \in E\}|}{ \frac{|N(v)|(|N(v)|-1)}{2}},

    where `N(v)` is the set of neighbors of `v` in `G`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
        A bipartite graph

    nodes : list or iterable (optional)
        Compute redundancy for these nodes. The default is all nodes in G.

    Returns
    -------
    redundancy : dictionary
        A dictionary keyed by node with the node redundancy value.

    Examples
    --------
    Compute the redundancy coefficient of each node in a graph::

        >>> from networkx.algorithms import bipartite
        >>> G = nx.cycle_graph(4)
        >>> rc = bipartite.node_redundancy(G)
        >>> rc[0]
        1.0

    Compute the average redundancy for the graph::

        >>> from networkx.algorithms import bipartite
        >>> G = nx.cycle_graph(4)
        >>> rc = bipartite.node_redundancy(G)
        >>> sum(rc.values()) / len(G)
        1.0

    Compute the average redundancy for a set of nodes::

        >>> from networkx.algorithms import bipartite
        >>> G = nx.cycle_graph(4)
        >>> rc = bipartite.node_redundancy(G)
        >>> nodes = [0, 2]
        >>> sum(rc[n] for n in nodes) / len(nodes)
        1.0

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If any of the nodes in the graph (or in `nodes`, if specified) has
        (out-)degree less than two (which would result in division by zero,
        according to the definition of the redundancy coefficient).
