    Parameters
    ----------

      A NetworkX graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph

        The algorithm can only be applied to chordal graphs. If the input

    Examples
    --------

    Notes
    -----
    G must be a chordal graph and (s,t) an edge that is not in G.

    If a treewidth_bound is provided, the search for induced nodes will end
    as soon as the treewidth_bound is exceeded.

    The algorithm is inspired by Algorithm 4 in [1]_.
    A formal definition of induced node can also be found on that reference.
