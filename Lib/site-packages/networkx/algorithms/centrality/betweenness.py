):
    r"""Compute the shortest-path betweenness centrality for nodes.

    Betweenness centrality of a node $v$ is the sum of the
    fraction of all-pairs shortest paths that pass through $v$

    .. math::

       c_B(v) =\sum_{s,t \in V} \frac{\sigma(s, t|v)}{\sigma(s, t)}

    where $V$ is the set of nodes, $\sigma(s, t)$ is the number of
    shortest $(s, t)$-paths,  and $\sigma(s, t|v)$ is the number of
    those paths  passing through some  node $v$ other than $s, t$.
    If $s = t$, $\sigma(s, t) = 1$, and if $v \in {s, t}$,
    $\sigma(s, t|v) = 0$ [2]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
      A NetworkX graph.

    k : int, optional (default=None)
      If k is not None use k node samples to estimate betweenness.
      The value of k <= n where n is the number of nodes in the graph.
      Higher values give better approximation.

    normalized : bool, optional
      If True the betweenness values are normalized by `2/((n-1)(n-2))`
      for graphs, and `1/((n-1)(n-2))` for directed graphs where `n`
      is the number of nodes in G.

    weight : None or string, optional (default=None)
      If None, all edge weights are considered equal.
      Otherwise holds the name of the edge attribute used as weight.
      Weights are used to calculate weighted shortest paths, so they are
      interpreted as distances.

    endpoints : bool, optional
      If True include the endpoints in the shortest path counts.

    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.
        Note that this is only used if k is not None.

    Returns
    -------
    nodes : dictionary
       Dictionary of nodes with betweenness centrality as the value.

    See Also
    --------
    edge_betweenness_centrality
    load_centrality

    Notes
    -----
    The algorithm is from Ulrik Brandes [1]_.
    See [4]_ for the original first published version and [2]_ for details on
    algorithms for variations and related metrics.

    For approximate betweenness calculations set k=#samples to use
    k nodes ("pivots") to estimate the betweenness values. For an estimate
    of the number of pivots needed see [3]_.

    For weighted graphs the edge weights must be greater than zero.
    Zero edge weights can produce an infinite number of equal length
    paths between pairs of nodes.

    The total number of paths between source and target is counted
    differently for directed and undirected graphs. Directed paths
    are easy to count. Undirected paths are tricky: should a path
    from "u" to "v" count as 1 undirected path or as 2 directed paths?

    For betweenness_centrality we report the number of undirected
    paths when G is undirected.

    For betweenness_centrality_subset the reporting is different.
    If the source and target subsets are the same, then we want
    to count undirected paths. But if the source and target subsets
    differ -- for example, if sources is {0} and targets is {1},
    then we are only counting the paths in one direction. They are
    undirected paths but we are counting them in a directed way.
    To count them as undirected paths, each should count as half a path.

    This algorithm is not guaranteed to be correct if edge weights
    are floating point numbers. As a workaround you can use integer
    numbers by multiplying the relevant edge attributes by a convenient
    constant factor (eg 100) and converting to integers.
