    The GN graph is built by adding nodes one at a time with a link to one
    previously added node.  The target node for the link is chosen with
    probability based on degree.  The default attachment kernel is a linear
    function of the degree of a node.

    The graph is always a (directed) tree.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        The number of nodes for the generated graph.
    kernel : function
        The attachment kernel.
    create_using : NetworkX graph constructor, optional (default DiGraph)

    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

    Examples
    --------
    To create the undirected GN graph, use the :meth:`~DiGraph.to_directed`
    method::

    >>> D = nx.gn_graph(10)  # the GN graph

    To specify an attachment kernel, use the `kernel` keyword argument::

    >>> D = nx.gn_graph(10, kernel=lambda x: x**1.5)  # A_k = k^1.5

        The out-degree of each node in the returned graph.

    alpha : float
        A positive :class:`float` representing the initial weight of
