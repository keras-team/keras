Coverage.py measures code coverage, typically during test execution. It uses
the code analysis tools and tracing hooks provided in the Python standard
library to determine which lines are executable, and which have been executed.

Coverage.py runs on these versions of Python:

.. PYVERSIONS

* Python 3.9 through 3.14 alpha 6, including free-threading.
* PyPy3 versions 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11.

Documentation is on `Read the Docs`_.  Code repository and issue tracker are on
`GitHub`_.
