    """
    Find the B-spline representation of an N-D curve.

    .. legacy:: function

        Specifically, we recommend using `make_splprep` in new code.

    Given a list of N rank-1 arrays, `x`, which represent a curve in
    N-dimensional space parametrized by `u`, find a smooth approximating
    spline curve g(`u`). Uses the FORTRAN routine parcur from FITPACK.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        A list of sample vector arrays representing the curve.
    w : array_like, optional
        Strictly positive rank-1 array of weights the same length as `x[0]`.
        The weights are used in computing the weighted least-squares spline
        fit. If the errors in the `x` values have standard-deviation given by
        the vector d, then `w` should be 1/d. Default is ``ones(len(x[0]))``.
    u : array_like, optional
        An array of parameter values. If not given, these values are
        calculated automatically as ``M = len(x[0])``, where

            v[0] = 0

            v[i] = v[i-1] + distance(`x[i]`, `x[i-1]`)

            u[i] = v[i] / v[M-1]

    ub, ue : int, optional
        The end-points of the parameters interval.  Defaults to
        u[0] and u[-1].
    k : int, optional
        Degree of the spline. Cubic splines are recommended.
        Even values of `k` should be avoided especially with a small s-value.
        ``1 <= k <= 5``, default is 3.
    task : int, optional
        If task==0 (default), find t and c for a given smoothing factor, s.
        If task==1, find t and c for another value of the smoothing factor, s.
        There must have been a previous call with task=0 or task=1
        for the same set of data.
        If task=-1 find the weighted least square spline for a given set of
        knots, t.
    s : float, optional
        A smoothing condition.  The amount of smoothness is determined by
        satisfying the conditions: ``sum((w * (y - g))**2,axis=0) <= s``,
        where g(x) is the smoothed interpolation of (x,y).  The user can
        use `s` to control the trade-off between closeness and smoothness
        of fit.  Larger `s` means more smoothing while smaller values of `s`
        indicate less smoothing. Recommended values of `s` depend on the
        weights, w.  If the weights represent the inverse of the
        standard-deviation of y, then a good `s` value should be found in
        the range ``(m-sqrt(2*m),m+sqrt(2*m))``, where m is the number of
        data points in x, y, and w.
    t : array, optional
        The knots needed for ``task=-1``.
        There must be at least ``2*k+2`` knots.
    full_output : int, optional
        If non-zero, then return optional outputs.
    nest : int, optional
        An over-estimate of the total number of knots of the spline to
        help in determining the storage space.  By default nest=m/2.
        Always large enough is nest=m+k+1.
    per : int, optional
       If non-zero, data points are considered periodic with period
       ``x[m-1] - x[0]`` and a smooth periodic spline approximation is
       returned.  Values of ``y[m-1]`` and ``w[m-1]`` are not used.
    quiet : int, optional
         Non-zero to suppress messages.

    Returns
    -------
    tck : tuple
        A tuple, ``(t,c,k)`` containing the vector of knots, the B-spline
        coefficients, and the degree of the spline.
    u : array
        An array of the values of the parameter.
    fp : float
        The weighted sum of squared residuals of the spline approximation.
    ier : int
        An integer flag about splrep success.  Success is indicated
        if ier<=0. If ier in [1,2,3] an error occurred but was not raised.
        Otherwise an error is raised.
    msg : str
        A message corresponding to the integer flag, ier.

    make_interp_spline

    Notes
    -----
    See `splev` for evaluation of the spline and its derivatives.
    The number of dimensions N must be smaller than 11.

    The number of coefficients in the `c` array is ``k+1`` less than the number
    of knots, ``len(t)``. This is in contrast with `splrep`, which zero-pads
    the array of coefficients to have the same length as the array of knots.
    These additional coefficients are ignored by evaluation routines, `splev`
    and `BSpline`.

    >>> tck, u = splprep([x, y], s=0)
    >>> new_points = splev(u, tck)

    Notice that (i) we force interpolation by using ``s=0``,
    (ii) the parameterization, ``u``, is generated automatically.
    Now plot the result:

    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    >>> ax.plot(x, y, 'ro')
    >>> ax.plot(new_points[0], new_points[1], 'r-')

    Given the set of data points ``(x[i], y[i])`` determine a smooth spline
    approximation of degree k on the interval ``xb <= x <= xe``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : array_like
        The data points defining a curve ``y = f(x)``.
    w : array_like, optional
        Strictly positive rank-1 array of weights the same length as `x` and `y`.
        The weights are used in computing the weighted least-squares spline
        fit. If the errors in the `y` values have standard-deviation given by the
        vector ``d``, then `w` should be ``1/d``. Default is ``ones(len(x))``.
    xb, xe : float, optional
        The interval to fit.  If None, these default to ``x[0]`` and ``x[-1]``
        respectively.
    k : int, optional
        The degree of the spline fit. It is recommended to use cubic splines.
        Even values of `k` should be avoided especially with small `s` values.
        ``1 <= k <= 5``.
    task : {1, 0, -1}, optional
        If ``task==0``, find ``t`` and ``c`` for a given smoothing factor, `s`.

        If ``task==1`` find ``t`` and ``c`` for another value of the smoothing factor,
        `s`. There must have been a previous call with ``task=0`` or ``task=1`` for
        the same set of data (``t`` will be stored an used internally)

        If ``task=-1`` find the weighted least square spline for a given set of
        knots, ``t``. These should be interior knots as knots on the ends will be
        added automatically.
    s : float, optional
        A smoothing condition. The amount of smoothness is determined by
        satisfying the conditions: ``sum((w * (y - g))**2,axis=0) <= s`` where ``g(x)``
        is the smoothed interpolation of ``(x,y)``. The user can use `s` to control
        the tradeoff between closeness and smoothness of fit. Larger `s` means
        more smoothing while smaller values of `s` indicate less smoothing.
        Recommended values of `s` depend on the weights, `w`. If the weights
        represent the inverse of the standard-deviation of `y`, then a good `s`
        value should be found in the range ``(m-sqrt(2*m),m+sqrt(2*m))`` where ``m`` is
        the number of datapoints in `x`, `y`, and `w`. default : ``s=m-sqrt(2*m)`` if
        weights are supplied. ``s = 0.0`` (interpolating) if no weights are
        supplied.
    t : array_like, optional
        The knots needed for ``task=-1``. If given then task is automatically set
        to ``-1``.
    full_output : bool, optional
        If non-zero, then return optional outputs.
    per : bool, optional
        If non-zero, data points are considered periodic with period ``x[m-1]`` -
        ``x[0]`` and a smooth periodic spline approximation is returned. Values of
        ``y[m-1]`` and ``w[m-1]`` are not used.
        The default is zero, corresponding to boundary condition 'not-a-knot'.
    quiet : bool, optional
        Non-zero to suppress messages.

    Returns
    -------
    tck : tuple
        A tuple ``(t,c,k)`` containing the vector of knots, the B-spline
        coefficients, and the degree of the spline.
    fp : array, optional
        The weighted sum of squared residuals of the spline approximation.
    ier : int, optional
        An integer flag about splrep success. Success is indicated if ``ier<=0``.
        If ``ier in [1,2,3]``, an error occurred but was not raised. Otherwise an
        error is raised.
    msg : str, optional
        A message corresponding to the integer flag, `ier`.

    Notes
    -----
    See `splev` for evaluation of the spline and its derivatives. Uses the
    FORTRAN routine ``curfit`` from FITPACK.

    The user is responsible for assuring that the values of `x` are unique.
    Otherwise, `splrep` will not return sensible results.

    If provided, knots `t` must satisfy the Schoenberg-Whitney conditions,
    i.e., there must be a subset of data points ``x[j]`` such that
    ``t[j] < x[j] < t[j+k+1]``, for ``j=0, 1,...,n-k-2``.

    This routine zero-pads the coefficients array ``c`` to have the same length
    as the array of knots ``t`` (the trailing ``k + 1`` coefficients are ignored
    by the evaluation routines, `splev` and `BSpline`.) This is in contrast with
    `splprep`, which does not zero-pad the coefficients.

    The default boundary condition is 'not-a-knot', i.e. the first and second
    segment at a curve end are the same polynomial. More boundary conditions are
    available in `CubicSpline`.

    Examples
    --------

    For some data, this method may miss a root. This happens when one of
    the spline knots (which FITPACK places automatically) happens to
    coincide with the true root. A workaround is to convert to `PPoly`,
    which uses a different root-finding algorithm.

    For example,

    >>> x = [1.96, 1.97, 1.98, 1.99, 2.00, 2.01, 2.02, 2.03, 2.04, 2.05]

    ...      6.520430e-03,  8.170770e-03]

    >>> tck = splrep(x, y, s=0)

    Converting to a PPoly object does find the roots at ``x=2``:

    Insert knots into a B-spline.

    .. legacy:: function

        Specifically, we recommend constructing a `BSpline` object and using
        its ``insert_knot`` method.

    Given the knots and coefficients of a B-spline representation, create a
    new B-spline with a knot inserted `m` times at point `x`.
    This is a wrapper around the FORTRAN routine insert of FITPACK.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x (u) : float
        A knot value at which to insert a new knot.  If `tck` was returned
        from ``splprep``, then the parameter values, u should be given.
    tck : a `BSpline` instance or a tuple
        If tuple, then it is expected to be a tuple (t,c,k) containing
        the vector of knots, the B-spline coefficients, and the degree of
        the spline.
    m : int, optional
        The number of times to insert the given knot (its multiplicity).
        Default is 1.
    per : int, optional
        If non-zero, the input spline is considered periodic.

    Returns
    -------
    BSpline instance or a tuple
        A new B-spline with knots t, coefficients c, and degree k.
        ``t(k+1) <= x <= t(n-k)``, where k is the degree of the spline.
        In case of a periodic spline (``per != 0``) there must be
        either at least k interior knots t(j) satisfying ``t(k+1)<t(j)<=x``
        or at least k interior knots t(j) satisfying ``x<=t(j)<t(n-k)``.
        A tuple is returned iff the input argument `tck` is a tuple, otherwise
        a BSpline object is constructed and returned.

    Notes
    -----
    Based on algorithms from [1]_ and [2]_.

    Manipulating the tck-tuples directly is not recommended. In new code,
    prefer using the `BSpline` objects, in particular `BSpline.insert_knot`
    method.

    Examples
    --------
    This can be used for finding maxima of a curve:

    >>> from scipy.interpolate import splrep, splder, sproot
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> x = np.linspace(0, 10, 70)
    >>> y = np.sin(x)
    >>> spl = splrep(x, y, k=4)

    Now, differentiate the spline and find the zeros of the
    derivative. (NB: `sproot` only works for order 3 splines, so we
    fit an order 4 spline):

    >>> dspl = splder(spl)
    >>> sproot(dspl) / np.pi
    array([ 0.50000001,  1.5       ,  2.49999998])

    This agrees well with roots :math:`\\pi/2 + n\\pi` of
    :math:`\\cos(x) = \\sin'(x)`.

    B-spline can be found in the `spalde` examples section.

    BSpline

    Notes
    -----
    The `splder` function is the inverse operation of this function.
    Namely, ``splder(splantider(tck))`` is identical to `tck`, modulo
    rounding error.

    .. versionadded:: 0.13.0

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from scipy.interpolate import splrep, splder, splantider, splev

    >>> y = 1 / np.sqrt(1 - 0.8*np.sin(x)**2)
    >>> spl = splrep(x, y)

    The derivative is the inverse operation of the antiderivative,
    although some floating point error accumulates:

    >>> splev(1.7, spl), splev(1.7, splder(splantider(spl)))
    (array(2.1565429877197317), array(2.1565429877201865))
