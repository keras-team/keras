    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Input array, can be complex.
    n : int, optional
        Length of the transformed axis of the output.
        If `n` is smaller than the length of the input, the input is cropped.
        If it is larger, the input is padded with zeros. If `n` is not given,
        the length of the input along the axis specified by `axis` is used.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis over which to compute the FFT. If not given, the last axis is
        used.
    norm : {"backward", "ortho", "forward"}, optional
        Normalization mode. Default is "backward", meaning no normalization on
        the forward transforms and scaling by ``1/n`` on the `ifft`.
        "forward" instead applies the ``1/n`` factor on the forward transform.
        For ``norm="ortho"``, both directions are scaled by ``1/sqrt(n)``.

        .. versionadded:: 1.6.0
           ``norm={"forward", "backward"}`` options were added

    overwrite_x : bool, optional
        If True, the contents of `x` can be destroyed; the default is False.
        See the notes below for more details.
    workers : int, optional
        Maximum number of workers to use for parallel computation. If negative,
        the value wraps around from ``os.cpu_count()``. See below for more
        details.
    plan : object, optional
        This argument is reserved for passing in a precomputed plan provided
        by downstream FFT vendors. It is currently not used in SciPy.

    out : complex ndarray
        The truncated or zero-padded input, transformed along the axis
        indicated by `axis`, or the last one if `axis` is not specified.

    Raises
    ------
    IndexError
        if `axes` is larger than the last axis of `x`.

    fftfreq : Frequency bins for given FFT parameters.
    next_fast_len : Size to pad input to for most efficient transforms

    Notes
    -----
    FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) refers to a way the discrete Fourier Transform
    (DFT) can be calculated efficiently, by using symmetries in the calculated
    terms. The symmetry is highest when `n` is a power of 2, and the transform
    is therefore most efficient for these sizes. For poorly factorizable sizes,
    `scipy.fft` uses Bluestein's algorithm [2]_ and so is never worse than
    O(`n` log `n`). Further performance improvements may be seen by zero-padding
    the input using `next_fast_len`.

    If ``x`` is a 1d array, then the `fft` is equivalent to ::

        y[k] = np.sum(x * np.exp(-2j * np.pi * k * np.arange(n)/n))

    The frequency term ``f=k/n`` is found at ``y[k]``. At ``y[n/2]`` we reach
    the Nyquist frequency and wrap around to the negative-frequency terms. So,
    for an 8-point transform, the frequencies of the result are
    [0, 1, 2, 3, -4, -3, -2, -1]. To rearrange the fft output so that the
    zero-frequency component is centered, like [-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3],
    use `fftshift`.

    Transforms can be done in single, double, or extended precision (long
    double) floating point. Half precision inputs will be converted to single
    precision and non-floating-point inputs will be converted to double
    precision.

    If the data type of ``x`` is real, a "real FFT" algorithm is automatically
    used, which roughly halves the computation time. To increase efficiency
    a little further, use `rfft`, which does the same calculation, but only
    outputs half of the symmetrical spectrum. If the data are both real and
    symmetrical, the `dct` can again double the efficiency, by generating
    half of the spectrum from half of the signal.

    When ``overwrite_x=True`` is specified, the memory referenced by ``x`` may
    be used by the implementation in any way. This may include reusing the
    memory for the result, but this is in no way guaranteed. You should not
    rely on the contents of ``x`` after the transform as this may change in
    future without warning.

    The ``workers`` argument specifies the maximum number of parallel jobs to
    split the FFT computation into. This will execute independent 1-D
    FFTs within ``x``. So, ``x`` must be at least 2-D and the
    non-transformed axes must be large enough to split into chunks. If ``x`` is
    too small, fewer jobs may be used than requested.

    Compute the 1-D inverse discrete Fourier Transform.

    This function computes the inverse of the 1-D *n*-point
    discrete Fourier transform computed by `fft`.  In other words,
    ``ifft(fft(x)) == x`` to within numerical accuracy.

    The input should be ordered in the same way as is returned by `fft`,
    i.e.,

    * ``x[0]`` should contain the zero frequency term,
    * ``x[1:n//2]`` should contain the positive-frequency terms,
    * ``x[n//2 + 1:]`` should contain the negative-frequency terms, in
      increasing order starting from the most negative frequency.

    For an even number of input points, ``x[n//2]`` represents the sum of
    the values at the positive and negative Nyquist frequencies, as the two
    are aliased together. See `fft` for details.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Input array, can be complex.
    n : int, optional
        Length of the transformed axis of the output.
        If `n` is smaller than the length of the input, the input is cropped.
        If it is larger, the input is padded with zeros. If `n` is not given,

        See notes about padding issues.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis over which to compute the inverse DFT. If not given, the last
        axis is used.

    -------
    out : complex ndarray
        The truncated or zero-padded input, transformed along the axis
        indicated by `axis`, or the last one if `axis` is not specified.

    Raises
    ------

    Notes
    -----
    If the input parameter `n` is larger than the size of the input, the input
    is padded by appending zeros at the end. Even though this is the common
    approach, it might lead to surprising results. If a different padding is
    desired, it must be performed before calling `ifft`.

    If ``x`` is a 1-D array, then the `ifft` is equivalent to ::

        y[k] = np.sum(x * np.exp(2j * np.pi * k * np.arange(n)/n)) / len(x)

    As with `fft`, `ifft` has support for all floating point types and is
    optimized for real input.

    --------
    >>> import scipy.fft
    >>> import numpy as np

    rfftn : The N-D FFT of real input.

    Notes
    -----
    When the DFT is computed for purely real input, the output is
    Hermitian-symmetric, i.e., the negative frequency terms are just the complex
    conjugates of the corresponding positive-frequency terms, and the
    negative-frequency terms are therefore redundant. This function does not
    compute the negative frequency terms, and the length of the transformed
    axis of the output is therefore ``n//2 + 1``.

    When ``X = rfft(x)`` and fs is the sampling frequency, ``X[0]`` contains
    the zero-frequency term 0*fs, which is real due to Hermitian symmetry.

    If `n` is even, ``A[-1]`` contains the term representing both positive
    and negative Nyquist frequency (+fs/2 and -fs/2), and must also be purely
    real. If `n` is odd, there is no term at fs/2; ``A[-1]`` contains
    the largest positive frequency (fs/2*(n-1)/n), and is complex in the
    general case.

    If the input `a` contains an imaginary part, it is silently discarded.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import scipy.fft
    >>> scipy.fft.fft([0, 1, 0, 0])
    array([ 1.+0.j,  0.-1.j, -1.+0.j,  0.+1.j]) # may vary
    >>> scipy.fft.rfft([0, 1, 0, 0])
    array([ 1.+0.j,  0.-1.j, -1.+0.j]) # may vary

    Notice how the final element of the `fft` output is the complex conjugate
    of the second element, for real input. For `rfft`, this symmetry is
    exploited to compute only the non-negative frequency terms.

    -----
    Returns the real valued `n`-point inverse discrete Fourier transform
    of `x`, where `x` contains the non-negative frequency terms of a
    Hermitian-symmetric sequence. `n` is the length of the result, not the
    input.

    If you specify an `n` such that `a` must be zero-padded or truncated, the
    extra/removed values will be added/removed at high frequencies. One can
    thus resample a series to `m` points via Fourier interpolation by:
    ``a_resamp = irfft(rfft(a), m)``.

    The default value of `n` assumes an even output length. By the Hermitian
    symmetry, the last imaginary component must be 0 and so is ignored. To
    avoid losing information, the correct length of the real input *must* be

    domain and is real in the frequency domain. So, here, it's `hfft`, for

    * even: ``ihfft(hfft(a, 2*len(a) - 2) == a``, within roundoff error,

    This function computes the N-D discrete Fourier Transform over
    any number of axes in an M-D real array by means of the Fast
    Fourier Transform (FFT). By default, all axes are transformed, with the
    real transform performed over the last axis, while the remaining
    transforms are complex.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Input array, taken to be real.
    s : sequence of ints, optional
        Shape (length along each transformed axis) to use from the input.
        (``s[0]`` refers to axis 0, ``s[1]`` to axis 1, etc.).
        The final element of `s` corresponds to `n` for ``rfft(x, n)``, while
        for the remaining axes, it corresponds to `n` for ``fft(x, n)``.
        Along any axis, if the given shape is smaller than that of the input,
        the input is cropped. If it is larger, the input is padded with zeros.
        if `s` is not given, the shape of the input along the axes specified
        by `axes` is used.
    axes : sequence of ints, optional
        Axes over which to compute the FFT. If not given, the last ``len(s)``
        axes are used, or all axes if `s` is also not specified.
    norm : {"backward", "ortho", "forward"}, optional
        Normalization mode (see `fft`). Default is "backward".
    overwrite_x : bool, optional
        If True, the contents of `x` can be destroyed; the default is False.
        See :func:`fft` for more details.
    workers : int, optional
        Maximum number of workers to use for parallel computation. If negative,
        the value wraps around from ``os.cpu_count()``.
        See :func:`~scipy.fft.fft` for more details.
    plan : object, optional
        This argument is reserved for passing in a precomputed plan provided
        by downstream FFT vendors. It is currently not used in SciPy.

        .. versionadded:: 1.5.0

    Returns
    -------
    out : complex ndarray
        The truncated or zero-padded input, transformed along the axes
        indicated by `axes`, or by a combination of `s` and `x`,
        as explained in the parameters section above.
        The length of the last axis transformed will be ``s[-1]//2+1``,
        while the remaining transformed axes will have lengths according to
        `s`, or unchanged from the input.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `s` and `axes` have different length.
    IndexError
        If an element of `axes` is larger than the number of axes of `x`.

    rfft : The 1-D FFT of real input.
    fftn : The N-D FFT.
    rfft2 : The 2-D FFT of real input.

    Notes
    -----
    The transform for real input is performed over the last transformation
    axis, as by `rfft`, then the transform over the remaining axes is
    performed as by `fftn`. The order of the output is as for `rfft` for the
    final transformation axis, and as for `fftn` for the remaining
    transformation axes.

    axes : sequence of ints, optional
        Axes over which to compute the inverse FFT. If not given, the last
        `len(s)` axes are used, or all axes if `s` is also not specified.
    norm : {"backward", "ortho", "forward"}, optional

        The truncated or zero-padded input, transformed along the axes

        as explained in the parameters section above.
        The length of each transformed axis is as given by the corresponding

        last one if `s` is not given. In the final transformed axis the length
        of the output when `s` is not given is ``2*(m-1)``, where ``m`` is the
        length of the final transformed axis of the input. To get an odd

    Raises
    ------

    Notes
    -----
    For a 1-D signal ``x`` to have a real spectrum, it must satisfy
    the Hermitian property::

        x[i] == np.conj(x[-i]) for all i

    This generalizes into higher dimensions by reflecting over each axis in
    turn::

        x[i, j, k, ...] == np.conj(x[-i, -j, -k, ...]) for all i, j, k, ...

    This should not be confused with a Hermitian matrix, for which the
    transpose is its own conjugate::

    The default value of `s` assumes an even output length in the final

    """
    Compute the 2-D inverse FFT of a real spectrum.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        The input array
    s : sequence of ints, optional
        Shape of the real input to the inverse FFT.
    axes : sequence of ints, optional
        The axes over which to compute the inverse fft.
        Default is the last two axes.
    norm : {"backward", "ortho", "forward"}, optional
        Normalization mode (see `fft`). Default is "backward".
    overwrite_x : bool, optional
        If True, the contents of `x` can be destroyed; the default is False.
        See :func:`fft` for more details.
    workers : int, optional
        Maximum number of workers to use for parallel computation. If negative,
        the value wraps around from ``os.cpu_count()``.
        See :func:`~scipy.fft.fft` for more details.
    plan : object, optional
        This argument is reserved for passing in a precomputed plan provided
        by downstream FFT vendors. It is currently not used in SciPy.

        .. versionadded:: 1.5.0

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        The result of the inverse real 2-D FFT.

    --------
    ihfftn : Compute the inverse of the N-D FFT of Hermitian input.

    Notes
    -----
    This is really `ihfftn` with different defaults.
    For more details see `ihfftn`.
