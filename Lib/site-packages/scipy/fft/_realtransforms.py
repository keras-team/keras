    idct : Inverse DCT

    Notes
    -----
    For a single dimension array ``x``, ``dct(x, norm='ortho')`` is equal to
    MATLAB ``dct(x)``.

    .. warning:: For ``type in {1, 2, 3}``, ``norm="ortho"`` breaks the direct
                 correspondence with the direct Fourier transform. To recover
                 it you must specify ``orthogonalize=False``.

    For ``norm="ortho"`` both the `dct` and `idct` are scaled by the same
    overall factor in both directions. By default, the transform is also
    orthogonalized which for types 1, 2 and 3 means the transform definition is
    modified to give orthogonality of the DCT matrix (see below).

    For ``norm="backward"``, there is no scaling on `dct` and the `idct` is
    scaled by ``1/N`` where ``N`` is the "logical" size of the DCT. For
    ``norm="forward"`` the ``1/N`` normalization is applied to the forward
    `dct` instead and the `idct` is unnormalized.

    There are, theoretically, 8 types of the DCT, only the first 4 types are
    implemented in SciPy.'The' DCT generally refers to DCT type 2, and 'the'
    Inverse DCT generally refers to DCT type 3.

    **Type I**

    There are several definitions of the DCT-I; we use the following
    (for ``norm="backward"``)

    .. math::

       y_k = x_0 + (-1)^k x_{N-1} + 2 \sum_{n=1}^{N-2} x_n \cos\left(
       \frac{\pi k n}{N-1} \right)

    If ``orthogonalize=True``, ``x[0]`` and ``x[N-1]`` are multiplied by a
    scaling factor of :math:`\sqrt{2}`, and ``y[0]`` and ``y[N-1]`` are divided
    by :math:`\sqrt{2}`. When combined with ``norm="ortho"``, this makes the
    corresponding matrix of coefficients orthonormal (``O @ O.T = np.eye(N)``).

    .. note::
       The DCT-I is only supported for input size > 1.

    **Type II**

    There are several definitions of the DCT-II; we use the following
    (for ``norm="backward"``)

    .. math::

       y_k = 2 \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n \cos\left(\frac{\pi k(2n+1)}{2N} \right)

    If ``orthogonalize=True``, ``y[0]`` is divided by :math:`\sqrt{2}` which,
    when combined with ``norm="ortho"``, makes the corresponding matrix of
    coefficients orthonormal (``O @ O.T = np.eye(N)``).

    **Type III**

    There are several definitions, we use the following (for
    ``norm="backward"``)

    .. math::

       y_k = x_0 + 2 \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} x_n \cos\left(\frac{\pi(2k+1)n}{2N}\right)

    If ``orthogonalize=True``, ``x[0]`` terms are multiplied by
    :math:`\sqrt{2}` which, when combined with ``norm="ortho"``, makes the
    corresponding matrix of coefficients orthonormal (``O @ O.T = np.eye(N)``).

    The (unnormalized) DCT-III is the inverse of the (unnormalized) DCT-II, up
    to a factor `2N`. The orthonormalized DCT-III is exactly the inverse of
    the orthonormalized DCT-II.

    **Type IV**

    There are several definitions of the DCT-IV; we use the following
    (for ``norm="backward"``)

    .. math::

       y_k = 2 \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n \cos\left(\frac{\pi(2k+1)(2n+1)}{4N} \right)

    ``orthogonalize`` has no effect here, as the DCT-IV matrix is already
    orthogonal up to a scale factor of ``2N``.

    .. math::

        y_k = 2 \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n \sin\left(\frac{\pi(k+1)(n+1)}{N+1}\right)

    Note that the DST-I is only supported for input size > 1.
    The (unnormalized) DST-I is its own inverse, up to a factor :math:`2(N+1)`.
    The orthonormalized DST-I is exactly its own inverse.

    ``orthogonalize`` has no effect here, as the DST-I matrix is already
    orthogonal up to a scale factor of ``2N``.

    **Type II**

    There are several definitions of the DST-II; we use the following for
    ``norm="backward"``. DST-II assumes the input is odd around :math:`n=-1/2` and
    :math:`n=N-1/2`; the output is odd around :math:`k=-1` and even around :math:`k=N-1`

    .. math::

        y_k = 2 \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n \sin\left(\frac{\pi(k+1)(2n+1)}{2N}\right)

    If ``orthogonalize=True``, ``y[-1]`` is divided :math:`\sqrt{2}` which, when
    combined with ``norm="ortho"``, makes the corresponding matrix of
    coefficients orthonormal (``O @ O.T = np.eye(N)``).

    **Type III**

    There are several definitions of the DST-III, we use the following (for
    ``norm="backward"``). DST-III assumes the input is odd around :math:`n=-1` and
    even around :math:`n=N-1`

    .. math::

        y_k = (-1)^k x_{N-1} + 2 \sum_{n=0}^{N-2} x_n \sin\left(
        \frac{\pi(2k+1)(n+1)}{2N}\right)

    If ``orthogonalize=True``, ``x[-1]`` is multiplied by :math:`\sqrt{2}`
    which, when combined with ``norm="ortho"``, makes the corresponding matrix
    of coefficients orthonormal (``O @ O.T = np.eye(N)``).

    The (unnormalized) DST-III is the inverse of the (unnormalized) DST-II, up
    to a factor :math:`2N`. The orthonormalized DST-III is exactly the inverse of the
    orthonormalized DST-II.

    **Type IV**

    There are several definitions of the DST-IV, we use the following (for
    ``norm="backward"``). DST-IV assumes the input is odd around :math:`n=-0.5` and
    even around :math:`n=N-0.5`

    .. math::

        y_k = 2 \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n \sin\left(\frac{\pi(2k+1)(2n+1)}{4N}\right)

    ``orthogonalize`` has no effect here, as the DST-IV matrix is already
    orthogonal up to a scale factor of ``2N``.

    The (unnormalized) DST-IV is its own inverse, up to a factor :math:`2N`. The
    orthonormalized DST-IV is exactly its own inverse.

    Return the Inverse Discrete Sine Transform of an arbitrary type sequence.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        The input array.
    type : {1, 2, 3, 4}, optional
        Type of the DST (see Notes). Default type is 2.
    n : int, optional
        Length of the transform. If ``n < x.shape[axis]``, `x` is
        truncated.  If ``n > x.shape[axis]``, `x` is zero-padded. The
        default results in ``n = x.shape[axis]``.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which the idst is computed; the default is over the
        last axis (i.e., ``axis=-1``).
    norm : {"backward", "ortho", "forward"}, optional
        Normalization mode (see Notes). Default is "backward".
    overwrite_x : bool, optional
        If True, the contents of `x` can be destroyed; the default is False.
    workers : int, optional
        Maximum number of workers to use for parallel computation. If negative,
        the value wraps around from ``os.cpu_count()``.
        See :func:`~scipy.fft.fft` for more details.
    orthogonalize : bool, optional
        Whether to use the orthogonalized IDST variant (see Notes).
        Defaults to ``True`` when ``norm="ortho"`` and ``False`` otherwise.

        .. versionadded:: 1.8.0

    Returns
    -------
    idst : ndarray of real
        The transformed input array.

    dst : Forward DST

    Notes
    -----
    .. warning:: For ``type in {2, 3}``, ``norm="ortho"`` breaks the direct
                 correspondence with the inverse direct Fourier transform.

    For ``norm="ortho"`` both the `dst` and `idst` are scaled by the same
    overall factor in both directions. By default, the transform is also
    orthogonalized which for types 2 and 3 means the transform definition is
    modified to give orthogonality of the DST matrix (see `dst` for the full
    definitions).

    'The' IDST is the IDST-II, which is the same as the normalized DST-III.

    The IDST is equivalent to a normal DST except for the normalization and
    type. DST type 1 and 4 are their own inverse and DSTs 2 and 3 are each
    other's inverses.
