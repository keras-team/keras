    Compute the generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram.

    The Lomb-Scargle periodogram was developed by Lomb [1]_ and further
    extended by Scargle [2]_ to find, and test the significance of weak
    periodic signals with uneven temporal sampling. The algorithm used
    here is based on a weighted least-squares fit of the form
    ``y(ω) = a*cos(ω*x) + b*sin(ω*x) + c``, where the fit is calculated for
    each frequency independently. This algorithm was developed by Zechmeister
    and Kürster which improves the Lomb-Scargle periodogram by enabling
    the weighting of individual samples and calculating an unknown y offset
    (also called a "floating-mean" model) [3]_. For more details, and practical
    considerations, see the excellent reference on the Lomb-Scargle periodogram [4]_.

    When *normalize* is False (or "power") (default) the computed periodogram
    is unnormalized, it takes the value ``(A**2) * N/4`` for a harmonic
    signal with amplitude A for sufficiently large N. Where N is the length of x or y.

    When *normalize* is True (or "normalize") the computed periodogram is normalized
    by the residuals of the data around a constant reference model (at zero).

    When *normalize* is "amplitude" the computed periodogram is the complex
    representation of the amplitude and phase.

    Input arrays should be 1-D of a real floating data type, which are converted into
    float64 arrays before processing.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Sample times.
    y : array_like
        Measurement values. Values are assumed to have a baseline of ``y = 0``. If
        there is a possibility of a y offset, it is recommended to set `floating_mean`
        to True.
    freqs : array_like
        Angular frequencies (e.g., having unit rad/s=2π/s for `x` having unit s) for
        output periodogram. Frequencies are normally >= 0, as any peak at ``-freq`` will
        also exist at ``+freq``.
    precenter : bool, optional
        Pre-center measurement values by subtracting the mean, if True. This is
        a legacy parameter and unnecessary if `floating_mean` is True.
    normalize : bool | str, optional
        Compute normalized or complex (amplitude + phase) periodogram.
        Valid options are: ``False``/``"power"``, ``True``/``"normalize"``, or
        ``"amplitude"``.
    weights : array_like, optional
        Weights for each sample. Weights must be nonnegative.
    floating_mean : bool, optional
        Determines a y offset for each frequency independently, if True.
        Else the y offset is assumed to be `0`.

    Returns
    -------
    pgram : array_like
        Lomb-Scargle periodogram.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If any of the input arrays x, y, freqs, or weights are not 1D, or if any are
        zero length. Or, if the input arrays x, y, and weights do not have the same
        shape as each other.
    ValueError
        If any weight is < 0, or the sum of the weights is <= 0.
    ValueError
        If the normalize parameter is not one of the allowed options.

    Notes
    -----
    The algorithm used will not automatically account for any unknown y offset, unless
    floating_mean is True. Therefore, for most use cases, if there is a possibility of
    a y offset, it is recommended to set floating_mean to True. If precenter is True,
    it performs the operation ``y -= y.mean()``. However, precenter is a legacy
    parameter, and unnecessary when floating_mean is True. Furthermore, the mean
    removed by precenter does not account for sample weights, nor will it correct for
    any bias due to consistently missing observations at peaks and/or troughs. When the
    normalize parameter is "amplitude", for any frequency in freqs that is below
    ``(2*pi)/(x.max() - x.min())``, the predicted amplitude will tend towards infinity.
    The concept of a "Nyquist frequency" limit (see Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem)
    is not generally applicable to unevenly sampled data. Therefore, with unevenly
    sampled data, valid frequencies in freqs can often be much higher than expected.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng()

    First define some input parameters for the signal:

    >>> A = 2.  # amplitude
    >>> c = 2.  # offset
    >>> w0 = 1.  # rad/sec
    >>> nin = 150
    >>> nout = 1002

    Randomly generate sample times:

    >>> x = rng.uniform(0, 10*np.pi, nin)

    Plot a sine wave for the selected times:

    >>> y = A * np.cos(w0*x) + c

    Define the array of frequencies for which to compute the periodogram:

    >>> w = np.linspace(0.25, 10, nout)

    Calculate Lomb-Scargle periodogram for each of the normalize options:

    >>> from scipy.signal import lombscargle
    >>> pgram_power = lombscargle(x, y, w, normalize=False)
    >>> pgram_norm = lombscargle(x, y, w, normalize=True)
    >>> pgram_amp = lombscargle(x, y, w, normalize='amplitude')
    ...
    >>> pgram_power_f = lombscargle(x, y, w, normalize=False, floating_mean=True)
    >>> pgram_norm_f = lombscargle(x, y, w, normalize=True, floating_mean=True)
    >>> pgram_amp_f = lombscargle(x, y, w, normalize='amplitude', floating_mean=True)

    Now make a plot of the input data:

    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> fig, (ax_t, ax_p, ax_n, ax_a) = plt.subplots(4, 1, figsize=(5, 6))
    >>> ax_t.plot(x, y, 'b+')
    >>> ax_t.set_xlabel('Time [s]')
    >>> ax_t.set_ylabel('Amplitude')

    Then plot the periodogram for each of the normalize options, as well as with and
    without floating_mean=True:

    >>> ax_p.plot(w, pgram_power, label='default')
    >>> ax_p.plot(w, pgram_power_f, label='floating_mean=True')
    >>> ax_p.set_xlabel('Angular frequency [rad/s]')
    >>> ax_p.set_ylabel('Power')
    >>> ax_p.legend(prop={'size': 7})
    ...
    >>> ax_n.plot(w, pgram_norm, label='default')
    >>> ax_n.plot(w, pgram_norm_f, label='floating_mean=True')
    >>> ax_n.set_xlabel('Angular frequency [rad/s]')
    >>> ax_n.set_ylabel('Normalized')
    >>> ax_n.legend(prop={'size': 7})
    ...
    >>> ax_a.plot(w, np.abs(pgram_amp), label='default')
    >>> ax_a.plot(w, np.abs(pgram_amp_f), label='floating_mean=True')
    >>> ax_a.set_xlabel('Angular frequency [rad/s]')
    >>> ax_a.set_ylabel('Amplitude')
    >>> ax_a.legend(prop={'size': 7})
    ...
    >>> plt.tight_layout()
    >>> plt.show()

    Estimate power spectral density using a periodogram.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Time series of measurement values
    fs : float, optional
        Sampling frequency of the `x` time series. Defaults to 1.0.
    window : str or tuple or array_like, optional
        Desired window to use. If `window` is a string or tuple, it is
        passed to `get_window` to generate the window values, which are
        DFT-even by default. See `get_window` for a list of windows and
        required parameters. If `window` is array_like it will be used
        directly as the window and its length must be equal to the length
        of the axis over which the periodogram is computed. Defaults
        to 'boxcar'.
    nfft : int, optional
        Length of the FFT used. If `None` the length of `x` will be
        used.
    detrend : str or function or `False`, optional
        Specifies how to detrend each segment. If `detrend` is a
        string, it is passed as the `type` argument to the `detrend`
        function. If it is a function, it takes a segment and returns a
        detrended segment. If `detrend` is `False`, no detrending is
        done. Defaults to 'constant'.
    return_onesided : bool, optional
        If `True`, return a one-sided spectrum for real data. If
        `False` return a two-sided spectrum. Defaults to `True`, but for
        complex data, a two-sided spectrum is always returned.
    scaling : { 'density', 'spectrum' }, optional
        Selects between computing the power spectral density ('density')
        where `Pxx` has units of V**2/Hz and computing the squared magnitude
        spectrum ('spectrum') where `Pxx` has units of V**2, if `x`
        is measured in V and `fs` is measured in Hz. Defaults to
        'density'
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which the periodogram is computed; the default is
        over the last axis (i.e. ``axis=-1``).

    Returns
    -------
    f : ndarray
        Array of sample frequencies.
    Pxx : ndarray
        Power spectral density or power spectrum of `x`.

    Estimate power spectral density using Welch's method.

    Welch's method [1]_ computes an estimate of the power spectral
    density by dividing the data into overlapping segments, computing a
    modified periodogram for each segment and averaging the
    periodograms.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Time series of measurement values
    fs : float, optional
        Sampling frequency of the `x` time series. Defaults to 1.0.
    window : str or tuple or array_like, optional
        Desired window to use. If `window` is a string or tuple, it is
        passed to `get_window` to generate the window values, which are
        DFT-even by default. See `get_window` for a list of windows and
        required parameters. If `window` is array_like it will be used
        directly as the window and its length must be nperseg. Defaults
        to a Hann window.
    nperseg : int, optional
        Length of each segment. Defaults to None, but if window is str or
        tuple, is set to 256, and if window is array_like, is set to the
        length of the window.
    noverlap : int, optional
        Number of points to overlap between segments. If `None`,
        ``noverlap = nperseg // 2``. Defaults to `None`.
    nfft : int, optional
        Length of the FFT used, if a zero padded FFT is desired. If
        `None`, the FFT length is `nperseg`. Defaults to `None`.
    detrend : str or function or `False`, optional
        Specifies how to detrend each segment. If `detrend` is a
        string, it is passed as the `type` argument to the `detrend`
        function. If it is a function, it takes a segment and returns a
        detrended segment. If `detrend` is `False`, no detrending is
        done. Defaults to 'constant'.
    return_onesided : bool, optional
        If `True`, return a one-sided spectrum for real data. If
        `False` return a two-sided spectrum. Defaults to `True`, but for
        complex data, a two-sided spectrum is always returned.
    scaling : { 'density', 'spectrum' }, optional
        Selects between computing the power spectral density ('density')
        where `Pxx` has units of V**2/Hz and computing the squared magnitude
        spectrum ('spectrum') where `Pxx` has units of V**2, if `x`
        is measured in V and `fs` is measured in Hz. Defaults to
        'density'
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which the periodogram is computed; the default is
        over the last axis (i.e. ``axis=-1``).
    average : { 'mean', 'median' }, optional
        Method to use when averaging periodograms. Defaults to 'mean'.

        .. versionadded:: 1.2.0

    Returns
    -------
    f : ndarray
        Array of sample frequencies.
    Pxx : ndarray
        Power spectral density or power spectrum of x.

    See Also
    --------
    periodogram: Simple, optionally modified periodogram
    lombscargle: Lomb-Scargle periodogram for unevenly sampled data

    Notes
    -----
    An appropriate amount of overlap will depend on the choice of window
    and on your requirements. For the default Hann window an overlap of
    50% is a reasonable trade off between accurately estimating the
    signal power, while not over counting any of the data. Narrower
    windows may require a larger overlap.

    If `noverlap` is 0, this method is equivalent to Bartlett's method
    [2]_.

    for a discussion of the scalings of the power spectral density and
    the (squared) magnitude spectrum.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from scipy import signal
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng()

    Generate a test signal, a 2 Vrms sine wave at 1234 Hz, corrupted by
    0.001 V**2/Hz of white noise sampled at 10 kHz.

    >>> fs = 10e3
    >>> N = 1e5
    >>> amp = 2*np.sqrt(2)
    >>> freq = 1234.0
    >>> noise_power = 0.001 * fs / 2
    >>> time = np.arange(N) / fs
    >>> x = amp*np.sin(2*np.pi*freq*time)
    >>> x += rng.normal(scale=np.sqrt(noise_power), size=time.shape)

    Compute and plot the power spectral density.

    >>> f, Pxx_den = signal.welch(x, fs, nperseg=1024)
    >>> plt.semilogy(f, Pxx_den)
    >>> plt.ylim([0.5e-3, 1])
    >>> plt.xlabel('frequency [Hz]')
    >>> plt.ylabel('PSD [V**2/Hz]')
    >>> plt.show()

    If we average the last half of the spectral density, to exclude the
    peak, we can recover the noise power on the signal.

    >>> np.mean(Pxx_den[256:])
    0.0009924865443739191

    Now compute and plot the power spectrum.

    >>> f, Pxx_spec = signal.welch(x, fs, 'flattop', 1024, scaling='spectrum')
    >>> plt.figure()
    >>> plt.semilogy(f, np.sqrt(Pxx_spec))
    >>> plt.xlabel('frequency [Hz]')
    >>> plt.ylabel('Linear spectrum [V RMS]')
    >>> plt.show()

    The peak height in the power spectrum is an estimate of the RMS
    amplitude.

    >>> np.sqrt(Pxx_spec.max())
    2.0077340678640727

    If we now introduce a discontinuity in the signal, by increasing the
    amplitude of a small portion of the signal by 50, we can see the
    corruption of the mean average power spectral density, but using a
    median average better estimates the normal behaviour.

    >>> x[int(N//2):int(N//2)+10] *= 50.
    >>> f, Pxx_den = signal.welch(x, fs, nperseg=1024)

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like

    fs : float, optional
        Sampling frequency of the `x` and `y` time series. Defaults
        to 1.0.
    window : str or tuple or array_like, optional
        Desired window to use. If `window` is a string or tuple, it is
        passed to `get_window` to generate the window values, which are
        DFT-even by default. See `get_window` for a list of windows and
        required parameters. If `window` is array_like it will be used
        directly as the window and its length must be nperseg. Defaults
        to a Hann window.
    nperseg : int, optional
        Length of each segment. Defaults to None, but if window is str or
        tuple, is set to 256, and if window is array_like, is set to the
        length of the window.
    noverlap: int, optional
        Number of points to overlap between segments. If `None`,
        ``noverlap = nperseg // 2``. Defaults to `None`.
    nfft : int, optional
        Length of the FFT used, if a zero padded FFT is desired. If
        `None`, the FFT length is `nperseg`. Defaults to `None`.
    detrend : str or function or `False`, optional
        Specifies how to detrend each segment. If `detrend` is a
        string, it is passed as the `type` argument to the `detrend`
        function. If it is a function, it takes a segment and returns a
        detrended segment. If `detrend` is `False`, no detrending is
        done. Defaults to 'constant'.
    return_onesided : bool, optional
        If `True`, return a one-sided spectrum for real data. If
        `False` return a two-sided spectrum. Defaults to `True`, but for
        complex data, a two-sided spectrum is always returned.
    scaling : { 'density', 'spectrum' }, optional
        Selects between computing the cross spectral density ('density')
        where `Pxy` has units of V**2/Hz and computing the cross spectrum
        ('spectrum') where `Pxy` has units of V**2, if `x` and `y` are
        measured in V and `fs` is measured in Hz. Defaults to 'density'
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which the CSD is computed for both inputs; the
        default is over the last axis (i.e. ``axis=-1``).
    average : { 'mean', 'median' }, optional
        Method to use when averaging periodograms. If the spectrum is
        complex, the average is computed separately for the real and
        imaginary parts. Defaults to 'mean'.

    coherence: Magnitude squared coherence by Welch's method.

    Notes
    -----
    By convention, Pxy is computed with the conjugate FFT of X
    multiplied by the FFT of Y.

    If the input series differ in length, the shorter series will be

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Time series of measurement values
    fs : float, optional
        Sampling frequency of the `x` time series. Defaults to 1.0.
    window : str or tuple or array_like, optional

        Defaults to a Tukey window with shape parameter of 0.25.

        Length of each segment. Defaults to None, but if window is str or
        tuple, is set to 256, and if window is array_like, is set to the
        length of the window.
    noverlap : int, optional
        Number of points to overlap between segments. If `None`,
        ``noverlap = nperseg // 8``. Defaults to `None`.
    nfft : int, optional
        Length of the FFT used, if a zero padded FFT is desired. If
        `None`, the FFT length is `nperseg`. Defaults to `None`.
    detrend : str or function or `False`, optional
        Specifies how to detrend each segment. If `detrend` is a
        string, it is passed as the `type` argument to the `detrend`

    return_onesided : bool, optional
        If `True`, return a one-sided spectrum for real data. If
        `False` return a two-sided spectrum. Defaults to `True`, but for
        complex data, a two-sided spectrum is always returned.
    scaling : { 'density', 'spectrum' }, optional
        Selects between computing the power spectral density ('density')
        where `Sxx` has units of V**2/Hz and computing the power
        spectrum ('spectrum') where `Sxx` has units of V**2, if `x`
        is measured in V and `fs` is measured in Hz. Defaults to
        'density'.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which the spectrogram is computed; the default is over
        the last axis (i.e. ``axis=-1``).
    mode : str, optional
        Defines what kind of return values are expected. Options are
        ['psd', 'complex', 'magnitude', 'angle', 'phase']. 'complex' is
        equivalent to the output of `stft` with no padding or boundary
        extension. 'magnitude' returns the absolute magnitude of the
        STFT. 'angle' and 'phase' return the complex angle of the STFT,
        with and without unwrapping, respectively.

    Returns
    -------
    f : ndarray
        Array of sample frequencies.
    t : ndarray
        Array of segment times.
    Sxx : ndarray
        Spectrogram of x. By default, the last axis of Sxx corresponds
        to the segment times.

                  which also includes a :meth:`~ShortTimeFFT.spectrogram`
                  method.

    Notes
    -----
    An appropriate amount of overlap will depend on the choice of window
    and on your requirements. In contrast to welch's method, where the
    entire data stream is averaged over, one may wish to use a smaller
    overlap (or perhaps none at all) when computing a spectrogram, to
    maintain some statistical independence between individual segments.
    It is for this reason that the default window is a Tukey window with
    1/8th of a window's length overlap at each end.

    Notes
    -----
    In order to enable inversion of an STFT via the inverse STFT in
    `istft`, it is sufficient that the signal windowing obeys the constraint of
    "Constant OverLap Add" (COLA). This ensures that every point in the input
    data is equally weighted, thereby avoiding aliasing and allowing full
    reconstruction.

    Some examples of windows that satisfy COLA:
        - Rectangular window at overlap of 0, 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, ...
        - Bartlett window at overlap of 1/2, 3/4, 5/6, ...
        - Hann window at 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, ...
        - Any Blackman family window at 2/3 overlap
        - Any window with ``noverlap = nperseg-1``

    A very comprehensive list of other windows may be found in [2]_,
    wherein the COLA condition is satisfied when the "Amplitude
    Flatness" is unity.

    This ensures that the normalization factors in the denominator of the

        `ShortTimeFFT` is a newer STFT / ISTFT implementation with more
        features. A :ref:`comparison <tutorial_stft_legacy_stft>` between the
        implementations can be found in the :ref:`tutorial_stft` section of the
        :ref:`user_guide`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Time series of measurement values
    fs : float, optional
        Sampling frequency of the `x` time series. Defaults to 1.0.
    window : str or tuple or array_like, optional
        Desired window to use. If `window` is a string or tuple, it is
        passed to `get_window` to generate the window values, which are
        DFT-even by default. See `get_window` for a list of windows and
        required parameters. If `window` is array_like it will be used
        directly as the window and its length must be nperseg. Defaults
        to a Hann window.
    nperseg : int, optional
        Length of each segment. Defaults to 256.
    noverlap : int, optional
        Number of points to overlap between segments. If `None`,
        ``noverlap = nperseg // 2``. Defaults to `None`. When
        specified, the COLA constraint must be met (see Notes below).
    nfft : int, optional
        Length of the FFT used, if a zero padded FFT is desired. If
        `None`, the FFT length is `nperseg`. Defaults to `None`.
    detrend : str or function or `False`, optional
        Specifies how to detrend each segment. If `detrend` is a
        string, it is passed as the `type` argument to the `detrend`
        function. If it is a function, it takes a segment and returns a
        detrended segment. If `detrend` is `False`, no detrending is
        done. Defaults to `False`.
    return_onesided : bool, optional
        If `True`, return a one-sided spectrum for real data. If
        `False` return a two-sided spectrum. Defaults to `True`, but for
        complex data, a two-sided spectrum is always returned.
    boundary : str or None, optional
        Specifies whether the input signal is extended at both ends, and
        how to generate the new values, in order to center the first
        windowed segment on the first input point. This has the benefit
        of enabling reconstruction of the first input point when the
        employed window function starts at zero. Valid options are
        ``['even', 'odd', 'constant', 'zeros', None]``. Defaults to
        'zeros', for zero padding extension. I.e. ``[1, 2, 3, 4]`` is
        extended to ``[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0]`` for ``nperseg=3``.
    padded : bool, optional
        Specifies whether the input signal is zero-padded at the end to
        make the signal fit exactly into an integer number of window
        segments, so that all of the signal is included in the output.
        Defaults to `True`. Padding occurs after boundary extension, if
        `boundary` is not `None`, and `padded` is `True`, as is the
        default.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which the STFT is computed; the default is over the
        last axis (i.e. ``axis=-1``).
    scaling: {'spectrum', 'psd'}
        The default 'spectrum' scaling allows each frequency line of `Zxx` to
        be interpreted as a magnitude spectrum. The 'psd' option scales each
        line to a power spectral density - it allows to calculate the signal's
        energy by numerically integrating over ``abs(Zxx)**2``.

        .. versionadded:: 1.9.0

    Returns
    -------
    f : ndarray
        Array of sample frequencies.
    t : ndarray
        Array of segment times.
    Zxx : ndarray
        STFT of `x`. By default, the last axis of `Zxx` corresponds
        to the segment times.

    Notes
    -----
    In order to enable inversion of an STFT via the inverse STFT in
    `istft`, the signal windowing must obey the constraint of "Nonzero
    OverLap Add" (NOLA), and the input signal must have complete
    windowing coverage (i.e. ``(x.shape[axis] - nperseg) %
    (nperseg-noverlap) == 0``). The `padded` argument may be used to
    accomplish this.

    Given a time-domain signal :math:`x[n]`, a window :math:`w[n]`, and a hop
    size :math:`H` = `nperseg - noverlap`, the windowed frame at time index
    :math:`t` is given by

    .. math:: x_{t}[n]=x[n]w[n-tH]

    The overlap-add (OLA) reconstruction equation is given by

    .. math:: x[n]=\frac{\sum_{t}x_{t}[n]w[n-tH]}{\sum_{t}w^{2}[n-tH]}

    The NOLA constraint ensures that every normalization term that appears
    in the denominator of the OLA reconstruction equation is nonzero. Whether a
    choice of `window`, `nperseg`, and `noverlap` satisfy this constraint can
    be tested with `check_NOLA`.

        implementations can be found in the :ref:`tutorial_stft` section of the
        :ref:`user_guide`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    Zxx : array_like
        STFT of the signal to be reconstructed. If a purely real array
        is passed, it will be cast to a complex data type.
    fs : float, optional
        Sampling frequency of the time series. Defaults to 1.0.
    window : str or tuple or array_like, optional
        Desired window to use. If `window` is a string or tuple, it is
        passed to `get_window` to generate the window values, which are
        DFT-even by default. See `get_window` for a list of windows and
        required parameters. If `window` is array_like it will be used
        directly as the window and its length must be nperseg. Defaults
        to a Hann window. Must match the window used to generate the
        STFT for faithful inversion.
    nperseg : int, optional
        Number of data points corresponding to each STFT segment. This
        parameter must be specified if the number of data points per
        segment is odd, or if the STFT was padded via ``nfft >
        nperseg``. If `None`, the value depends on the shape of
        `Zxx` and `input_onesided`. If `input_onesided` is `True`,
        ``nperseg=2*(Zxx.shape[freq_axis] - 1)``. Otherwise,
        ``nperseg=Zxx.shape[freq_axis]``. Defaults to `None`.
    noverlap : int, optional
        Number of points to overlap between segments. If `None`, half
        of the segment length. Defaults to `None`. When specified, the
        COLA constraint must be met (see Notes below), and should match
        the parameter used to generate the STFT. Defaults to `None`.
    nfft : int, optional
        Number of FFT points corresponding to each STFT segment. This
        parameter must be specified if the STFT was padded via ``nfft >
        nperseg``. If `None`, the default values are the same as for
        `nperseg`, detailed above, with one exception: if
        `input_onesided` is True and
        ``nperseg==2*Zxx.shape[freq_axis] - 1``, `nfft` also takes on
        that value. This case allows the proper inversion of an
        odd-length unpadded STFT using ``nfft=None``. Defaults to
        `None`.
    input_onesided : bool, optional
        If `True`, interpret the input array as one-sided FFTs, such
        as is returned by `stft` with ``return_onesided=True`` and
        `numpy.fft.rfft`. If `False`, interpret the input as a a
        two-sided FFT. Defaults to `True`.
    boundary : bool, optional
        Specifies whether the input signal was extended at its
        boundaries by supplying a non-`None` ``boundary`` argument to
        `stft`. Defaults to `True`.
    time_axis : int, optional
        Where the time segments of the STFT is located; the default is
        the last axis (i.e. ``axis=-1``).
    freq_axis : int, optional
        Where the frequency axis of the STFT is located; the default is
        the penultimate axis (i.e. ``axis=-2``).
    scaling: {'spectrum', 'psd'}
        The default 'spectrum' scaling allows each frequency line of `Zxx` to
        be interpreted as a magnitude spectrum. The 'psd' option scales each
        line to a power spectral density - it allows to calculate the signal's
        energy by numerically integrating over ``abs(Zxx)**2``.

    Returns
    -------
    t : ndarray
        Array of output data times.
    x : ndarray
        iSTFT of `Zxx`.

    Notes
    -----
    In order to enable inversion of an STFT via the inverse STFT with
    `istft`, the signal windowing must obey the constraint of "nonzero
    overlap add" (NOLA):

    .. math:: \sum_{t}w^{2}[n-tH] \ne 0

    This ensures that the normalization factors that appear in the denominator
    of the overlap-add reconstruction equation

    .. math:: x[n]=\frac{\sum_{t}x_{t}[n]w[n-tH]}{\sum_{t}w^{2}[n-tH]}

    are not zero. The NOLA constraint can be checked with the `check_NOLA`
    function.

    An STFT which has been modified (via masking or otherwise) is not
    guaranteed to correspond to a exactly realizible signal. This
    function implements the iSTFT via the least-squares estimation
    algorithm detailed in [2]_, which produces a signal that minimizes
    the mean squared error between the STFT of the returned signal and
    the modified STFT.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from scipy import signal
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng()

    Generate a test signal, a 2 Vrms sine wave at 50Hz corrupted by
    0.001 V**2/Hz of white noise sampled at 1024 Hz.

    >>> fs = 1024
    >>> N = 10*fs
    >>> nperseg = 512
    >>> amp = 2 * np.sqrt(2)
    >>> noise_power = 0.001 * fs / 2
    >>> time = np.arange(N) / float(fs)
    >>> carrier = amp * np.sin(2*np.pi*50*time)
    >>> noise = rng.normal(scale=np.sqrt(noise_power),
    ...                    size=time.shape)
    >>> x = carrier + noise

    Compute the STFT, and plot its magnitude

    >>> f, t, Zxx = signal.stft(x, fs=fs, nperseg=nperseg)
    >>> plt.figure()
    >>> plt.pcolormesh(t, f, np.abs(Zxx), vmin=0, vmax=amp, shading='gouraud')
    >>> plt.ylim([f[1], f[-1]])
    >>> plt.title('STFT Magnitude')
    >>> plt.ylabel('Frequency [Hz]')
    >>> plt.xlabel('Time [sec]')
    >>> plt.yscale('log')
    >>> plt.show()

    Zero the components that are 10% or less of the carrier magnitude,
    then convert back to a time series via inverse STFT

    >>> Zxx = np.where(np.abs(Zxx) >= amp/10, Zxx, 0)
    >>> _, xrec = signal.istft(Zxx, fs)

    Compare the cleaned signal with the original and true carrier signals.

    >>> plt.figure()
    >>> plt.plot(time, x, time, xrec, time, carrier)
    >>> plt.xlim([2, 2.1])
    >>> plt.xlabel('Time [sec]')
    >>> plt.ylabel('Signal')
    >>> plt.legend(['Carrier + Noise', 'Filtered via STFT', 'True Carrier'])
    >>> plt.show()

    Note that the cleaned signal does not start as abruptly as the original,
    since some of the coefficients of the transient were also removed:

    >>> plt.figure()
    >>> plt.plot(time, x, time, xrec, time, carrier)
    >>> plt.xlim([0, 0.1])
    >>> plt.xlabel('Time [sec]')
    >>> plt.ylabel('Signal')
    >>> plt.legend(['Carrier + Noise', 'Filtered via STFT', 'True Carrier'])
    >>> plt.show()

def coherence(x, y, fs=1.0, window='hann', nperseg=None, noverlap=None,
              nfft=None, detrend='constant', axis=-1):
    r"""
    Estimate the magnitude squared coherence estimate, Cxy, of
    discrete-time signals X and Y using Welch's method.

    ``Cxy = abs(Pxy)**2/(Pxx*Pyy)``, where `Pxx` and `Pyy` are power
    spectral density estimates of X and Y, and `Pxy` is the cross
    spectral density estimate of X and Y.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Time series of measurement values
    y : array_like
        Time series of measurement values
    fs : float, optional
        Sampling frequency of the `x` and `y` time series. Defaults
        to 1.0.
    window : str or tuple or array_like, optional
        Desired window to use. If `window` is a string or tuple, it is
        passed to `get_window` to generate the window values, which are
        DFT-even by default. See `get_window` for a list of windows and
        required parameters. If `window` is array_like it will be used
        directly as the window and its length must be nperseg. Defaults
        to a Hann window.
    nperseg : int, optional
        Length of each segment. Defaults to None, but if window is str or
        tuple, is set to 256, and if window is array_like, is set to the
        length of the window.
    noverlap: int, optional
        Number of points to overlap between segments. If `None`,
        ``noverlap = nperseg // 2``. Defaults to `None`.
    nfft : int, optional
        Length of the FFT used, if a zero padded FFT is desired. If
        `None`, the FFT length is `nperseg`. Defaults to `None`.
    detrend : str or function or `False`, optional
        Specifies how to detrend each segment. If `detrend` is a
        string, it is passed as the `type` argument to the `detrend`
        function. If it is a function, it takes a segment and returns a
        detrended segment. If `detrend` is `False`, no detrending is
        done. Defaults to 'constant'.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which the coherence is computed for both inputs; the
        default is over the last axis (i.e. ``axis=-1``).

    Returns
    -------
    f : ndarray
        Array of sample frequencies.
    Cxy : ndarray
        Magnitude squared coherence of x and y.

    See Also
    --------
    periodogram: Simple, optionally modified periodogram
    lombscargle: Lomb-Scargle periodogram for unevenly sampled data
    welch: Power spectral density by Welch's method.
    csd: Cross spectral density by Welch's method.

    Notes
    -----
    An appropriate amount of overlap will depend on the choice of window
    and on your requirements. For the default Hann window an overlap of
    50% is a reasonable trade off between accurately estimating the
    signal power, while not over counting any of the data. Narrower
    windows may require a larger overlap.

    This is a helper function that implements the commonality between

    be called externally. The windows are not averaged over; the result
    from each window is returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Array or sequence containing the data to be analyzed.
    y : array_like
        Array or sequence containing the data to be analyzed. If this is
        the same object in memory as `x` (i.e. ``_spectral_helper(x,
        x, ...)``), the extra computations are spared.
    fs : float, optional
        Sampling frequency of the time series. Defaults to 1.0.
    window : str or tuple or array_like, optional
        Desired window to use. If `window` is a string or tuple, it is
        passed to `get_window` to generate the window values, which are
        DFT-even by default. See `get_window` for a list of windows and
        required parameters. If `window` is array_like it will be used
        directly as the window and its length must be nperseg. Defaults
        to a Hann window.
    nperseg : int, optional
        Length of each segment. Defaults to None, but if window is str or
        tuple, is set to 256, and if window is array_like, is set to the
        length of the window.
    noverlap : int, optional
        Number of points to overlap between segments. If `None`,
        ``noverlap = nperseg // 2``. Defaults to `None`.
    nfft : int, optional
        Length of the FFT used, if a zero padded FFT is desired. If
        `None`, the FFT length is `nperseg`. Defaults to `None`.
    detrend : str or function or `False`, optional
        Specifies how to detrend each segment. If `detrend` is a
        string, it is passed as the `type` argument to the `detrend`
        function. If it is a function, it takes a segment and returns a
        detrended segment. If `detrend` is `False`, no detrending is
        done. Defaults to 'constant'.
    return_onesided : bool, optional
        If `True`, return a one-sided spectrum for real data. If
        `False` return a two-sided spectrum. Defaults to `True`, but for
        complex data, a two-sided spectrum is always returned.
    scaling : { 'density', 'spectrum' }, optional
        Selects between computing the cross spectral density ('density')
        where `Pxy` has units of V**2/Hz and computing the cross
        spectrum ('spectrum') where `Pxy` has units of V**2, if `x`
        and `y` are measured in V and `fs` is measured in Hz.
        Defaults to 'density'
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which the FFTs are computed; the default is over the
        last axis (i.e. ``axis=-1``).
    mode: str {'psd', 'stft'}, optional
        Defines what kind of return values are expected. Defaults to
        'psd'.
    boundary : str or None, optional
        Specifies whether the input signal is extended at both ends, and
        how to generate the new values, in order to center the first
        windowed segment on the first input point. This has the benefit
        of enabling reconstruction of the first input point when the
        employed window function starts at zero. Valid options are
        ``['even', 'odd', 'constant', 'zeros', None]``. Defaults to
        `None`.
    padded : bool, optional
        Specifies whether the input signal is zero-padded at the end to
        make the signal fit exactly into an integer number of window
        segments, so that all of the signal is included in the output.
        Defaults to `False`. Padding occurs after boundary extension, if
        `boundary` is not `None`, and `padded` is `True`.

    Returns
    -------
    freqs : ndarray
        Array of sample frequencies.
    t : ndarray
        Array of times corresponding to each data segment
    result : ndarray
        Array of output data, contents dependent on *mode* kwarg.
