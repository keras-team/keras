"""Simplex method for  linear programming

The *simplex* method uses a traditional, full-tableau implementation of
Dantzig's simplex algorithm [1]_, [2]_ (*not* the Nelder-Mead simplex).
This algorithm is included for backwards compatibility and educational
purposes.

    .. versionadded:: 0.15.0

Warnings
--------

The simplex method may encounter numerical difficulties when pivot
values are close to the specified tolerance. If encountered try
remove any redundant constraints, change the pivot strategy to Bland's
rule or increase the tolerance value.

Alternatively, more robust methods maybe be used. See
:ref:`'interior-point' <optimize.linprog-interior-point>` and
:ref:`'revised simplex' <optimize.linprog-revised_simplex>`.

                The (nominally zero) residuals of the equality constraints,
                that is, ``b - A_eq @ x``
            phase : int
                The phase of the algorithm being executed.
            status : int
                An integer representing the status of the optimization::

                     0 : Algorithm proceeding nominally
                     1 : Iteration limit reached
                     2 : Problem appears to be infeasible
                     3 : Problem appears to be unbounded
                     4 : Serious numerical difficulties encountered
            nit : int
                The number of iterations performed.
            message : str
                A string descriptor of the exit status of the optimization.
    postsolve_args : tuple
        Data needed by _postsolve to convert the solution to the standard-form
        problem into the solution to the original problem.

    Options
    -------
    maxiter : int
       The maximum number of iterations to perform.
    disp : bool
        If True, print exit status message to sys.stdout
    tol : float
        The tolerance which determines when a solution is "close enough" to
        zero in Phase 1 to be considered a basic feasible solution or close
        enough to positive to serve as an optimal solution.
    bland : bool
        If True, use Bland's anti-cycling rule [3]_ to choose pivots to
        prevent cycling. If False, choose pivots which should lead to a
        converged solution more quickly. The latter method is subject to
        cycling (non-convergence) in rare instances.
    unknown_options : dict
        Optional arguments not used by this particular solver. If
        `unknown_options` is non-empty a warning is issued listing all
        unused options.

    Returns
    -------
    x : 1-D array
        Solution vector.
    status : int
        An integer representing the exit status of the optimization::

         0 : Optimization terminated successfully
         1 : Iteration limit reached
         2 : Problem appears to be infeasible
         3 : Problem appears to be unbounded
         4 : Serious numerical difficulties encountered

    message : str
        A string descriptor of the exit status of the optimization.
    iteration : int
        The number of iterations taken to solve the problem.

    Notes
    -----
    The expected problem formulation differs between the top level ``linprog``
    module and the method specific solvers. The method specific solvers expect a
    problem in standard form:

    Minimize::

        c @ x

    Subject to::

        A @ x == b
            x >= 0

    Whereas the top level ``linprog`` module expects a problem of form:

    Minimize::

        c @ x

    Subject to::

        A_ub @ x <= b_ub
        A_eq @ x == b_eq
         lb <= x <= ub

    where ``lb = 0`` and ``ub = None`` unless set in ``bounds``.

    The original problem contains equality, upper-bound and variable constraints
    whereas the method specific solver requires equality constraints and
    variable non-negativity.

    ``linprog`` module converts the original problem to standard form by
    converting the simple bounds to upper bound constraints, introducing
    non-negative slack variables for inequality constraints, and expressing
    unbounded variables as the difference between two non-negative variables.
