tzdata: Python package providing IANA time zone data
====================================================

This is a Python package containing ``zic``-compiled binaries for the IANA time
zone database. It is intended to be a fallback for systems that do not have
system time zone data installed (or don't have it installed in a standard
location), as a part of `PEP 615 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0615/>`_

This repository generates a ``pip``-installable package, published on PyPI as
`tzdata <https://pypi.org/project/tzdata>`_.

For more information, see `the documentation <https://tzdata.readthedocs.io>`_.
