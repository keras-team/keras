# Treescope

Treescope is an interactive HTML pretty-printer and N-dimensional array
("tensor") visualizer, designed for machine learning and neural networks
research in IPython notebooks. It's a drop-in replacement for the standard
IPython/Colab renderer, and adds support for:

* Expanding and collapsing subtrees of rendered objects, to let you focus on
  the parts of your model that you care about,
* Automatically embedding faceted visualizations of arbitrary-dimensional arrays
  and tensors directly into the output renderings, so you can quickly understand
  their shapes and the distribution of their values,
* Color-coding parts of neural network models to emphasize shared structures,
* Inserting "copy path" buttons that let you easily copy the path to any part of
  a rendered object,
* Customizing the visualization strategy to support rendering your own data
  structures,
* And more!

Treescope was originally developed as the pretty-printer for the
[Penzai neural network library](https://penzai.readthedocs.io/en/stable), but
it also supports rendering neural networks developed with other libraries,
including
[Equinox](https://docs.kidger.site/equinox/),
[Flax NNX](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nnx/index.html),
and
[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/).
You can also use it with basic
[JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
and
[Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/)
code.


With Treescope, instead of looking at this:

You could be looking at this:

This is an interactive visualization; try clicking the `â–¶` buttons to expand
parts of the output! (You can also hold shift while scrolling to
scroll horizontally instead of vertically.)

Documentation on Treescope can be found at
[https://treescope.readthedocs.io](https://treescope.readthedocs.io).


## Getting Started

You can install Treescope using:

```bash
pip install treescope
```

and import it using:

```python
import treescope
```

To render a specific object in an IPython notebook with Treescope, you can use
`treescope.show`, which is like `print` but produces a rich interactive output.

Alternatively, you can simply configure Treescope as the default pretty printer
for your notebook via:

```python
treescope.register_as_default()
```

To turn on automatic array visualization, you can run:

```python
treescope.active_autovisualizer.set_globally(treescope.ArrayAutovisualizer())
```

Or, if you'd like to both set up Treescope as the default pretty printer and
enable automatic array visualization, you can simply run:

```python
treescope.basic_interactive_setup(autovisualize_arrays=True)
```

Once you've rendered an object, try clicking on it and pressing the `r` key!
This turns on "roundtrip mode", and adds qualified names to every type in the
visualization, making it easier to identify what the types in your object are.

> [!TIP]
> If Treescope's outputs are too verbose, or if you are using a terminal that
> wraps lines, you can configure Treescope to abbreviate collapsed objects at a
> given depth using:
>
> ```python
> treescope.basic_interactive_setup(
>     autovisualize_arrays=True,
>     abbreviation_threshold=1,  # or a different value
> )
> ```
>
> You can also configure the abbreviation threshold manually by overriding
> `treescope.abbreviation_threshold` using the `.set_globally` or `.set_scoped`
> methods.

For more information on how to use Treescope, check out the
[Treescope documentation](https://treescope.readthedocs.io).
