    """Spatial 2D version of Dropout.

    This version performs the same function as Dropout, however, it drops
    entire 2D feature maps instead of individual elements. If adjacent pixels
    within feature maps are strongly correlated (as is normally the case in
    early convolution layers) then regular dropout will not regularize the
    activations and will otherwise just result in an effective learning rate
    decrease. In this case, SpatialDropout2D will help promote independence
    between feature maps and should be used instead.

    Args:
      rate: Float between 0 and 1. Fraction of the input units to drop.
      data_format: 'channels_first' or 'channels_last'. In 'channels_first'
        mode, the channels dimension (the depth) is at index 1, in
        'channels_last' mode is it at index 3. When unspecified, uses
        `image_data_format` value found in your TF-Keras config file at
        `~/.keras/keras.json` (if exists) else 'channels_last'.
        Defaults to 'channels_last'.
    Call arguments:
      inputs: A 4D tensor.
      training: Python boolean indicating whether the layer should behave in
        training mode (adding dropout) or in inference mode (doing nothing).
    Input shape:
      4D tensor with shape: `(samples, channels, rows, cols)` if
        data_format='channels_first'
      or 4D tensor with shape: `(samples, rows, cols, channels)` if
        data_format='channels_last'.
    Output shape: Same as input.
