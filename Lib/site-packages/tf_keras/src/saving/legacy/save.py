    """Saves a model as a TensorFlow SavedModel or HDF5 file.

    See the [Serialization and Saving
    guide](https://keras.io/guides/serialization_and_saving/) for details.

    Usage:

    >>> model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    ...     tf.keras.layers.Dense(5, input_shape=(3,)),
    ...     tf.keras.layers.Softmax()])
    >>> model.save('/tmp/model')
    >>> loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('/tmp/model')
    >>> x = tf.random.uniform((10, 3))
    >>> assert np.allclose(model.predict(x), loaded_model.predict(x))

    Note that `model.save()` is an alias for `tf.keras.models.save_model()`.

    The SavedModel and HDF5 file contains:

    - the model's configuration (topology)
    - the model's weights
    - the model's optimizer's state (if any)

    Thus models can be reinstantiated in the exact same state, without any of
    the code used for model definition or training.

    Note that the model weights may have different scoped names after being
    loaded. Scoped names include the model/layer names, such as
    `"dense_1/kernel:0"`. It is recommended that you use the layer properties to
    access specific variables, e.g. `model.get_layer("dense_1").kernel`.

    __SavedModel serialization format__

    TF-Keras SavedModel uses `tf.saved_model.save` to save the model and all
    trackable objects attached to the model (e.g. layers and variables). The
    model config, weights, and optimizer are saved in the SavedModel.
    Additionally, for every TF-Keras layer attached to the model, the SavedModel
    stores:

      * the config and metadata -- e.g. name, dtype, trainable status
      * traced call and loss functions, which are stored as TensorFlow
        subgraphs.

    The traced functions allow the SavedModel format to save and load custom
    layers without the original class definition.

    You can choose to not save the traced functions by disabling the
    `save_traces` option. This will decrease the time it takes to save the model
    and the amount of disk space occupied by the output SavedModel. If you
    enable this option, then you _must_ provide all custom class definitions
    when loading the model. See the `custom_objects` argument in
    `tf.keras.models.load_model`.

    Args:
        model: TF-Keras model instance to be saved.
        filepath: One of the following:
          - String or `pathlib.Path` object, path where to save the model
          - `h5py.File` object where to save the model
        overwrite: Whether we should overwrite any existing model at the target
          location, or instead ask the user with a manual prompt.
        include_optimizer: If True, save optimizer's state together.
        save_format: Either 'tf' or 'h5', indicating whether to save the model
          to Tensorflow SavedModel or HDF5. Defaults to 'tf' in TF 2.X, and 'h5'
          in TF 1.X.
        signatures: Signatures to save with the SavedModel. Applicable to the
          'tf' format only. Please see the `signatures` argument in
          `tf.saved_model.save` for details.
        options: (only applies to SavedModel format)
          `tf.saved_model.SaveOptions` object that specifies options for saving
          to SavedModel.
        save_traces: (only applies to SavedModel format) When enabled, the
          SavedModel will store the function traces for each layer. This
          can be disabled, so that only the configs of each layer are stored.
          Defaults to `True`. Disabling this will decrease serialization time
          and reduce file size, but it requires that all custom layers/models
          implement a `get_config()` method.

    Raises:
        ImportError: If save format is hdf5, and h5py is not available.

    """Saves all layer weights.

    Either saves in HDF5 or in TensorFlow format based on the `save_format`
    argument.

    When saving in HDF5 format, the weight file has:
        - `layer_names` (attribute), a list of strings
            (ordered names of model layers).
        - For every layer, a `group` named `layer.name`
            - For every such layer group, a group attribute `weight_names`,
                a list of strings
                (ordered names of weights tensor of the layer).
            - For every weight in the layer, a dataset
                storing the weight value, named after the weight tensor.

    When saving in TensorFlow format, all objects referenced by the network
    are saved in the same format as `tf.train.Checkpoint`, including any
    `Layer` instances or `Optimizer` instances assigned to object
    attributes. For networks constructed from inputs and outputs using
    `tf.keras.Model(inputs, outputs)`, `Layer` instances used by the network
    are tracked/saved automatically. For user-defined classes which inherit
    from `tf.keras.Model`, `Layer` instances must be assigned to object
    attributes, typically in the constructor. See the documentation of
    `tf.train.Checkpoint` and `tf.keras.Model` for details.

    While the formats are the same, do not mix `save_weights` and
    `tf.train.Checkpoint`. Checkpoints saved by `Model.save_weights` should
    be loaded using `Model.load_weights`. Checkpoints saved using
    `tf.train.Checkpoint.save` should be restored using the corresponding
    `tf.train.Checkpoint.restore`. Prefer `tf.train.Checkpoint` over
    `save_weights` for training checkpoints.

    The TensorFlow format matches objects and variables by starting at a
    root object, `self` for `save_weights`, and greedily matching attribute
    names. For `Model.save` this is the `Model`, and for `Checkpoint.save`
    this is the `Checkpoint` even if the `Checkpoint` has a model attached.
    This means saving a `tf.keras.Model` using `save_weights` and loading
    into a `tf.train.Checkpoint` with a `Model` attached (or vice versa)
    will not match the `Model`'s variables. See the
    [guide to training checkpoints](
    https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/checkpoint) for details on
    the TensorFlow format.

            the '.h5' suffix causes weights to be saved in HDF5 format.
        overwrite: Whether to silently overwrite any existing file at the
            target location, or provide the user with a manual prompt.
        save_format: Either 'tf' or 'h5'. A `filepath` ending in '.h5' or
