    """Loads the MNIST dataset.

    This is a dataset of 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of the 10 digits,
    along with a test set of 10,000 images.
    More info can be found at the
    [MNIST homepage](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

    Args:
      path: path where to cache the dataset locally
        (relative to `~/.keras/datasets`).

    Returns:
      Tuple of NumPy arrays: `(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test)`.

    **x_train**: uint8 NumPy array of grayscale image data with shapes
      `(60000, 28, 28)`, containing the training data. Pixel values range
      from 0 to 255.

    **y_train**: uint8 NumPy array of digit labels (integers in range 0-9)
      with shape `(60000,)` for the training data.

    **x_test**: uint8 NumPy array of grayscale image data with shapes
      (10000, 28, 28), containing the test data. Pixel values range
      from 0 to 255.

    **y_test**: uint8 NumPy array of digit labels (integers in range 0-9)
      with shape `(10000,)` for the test data.

    Example:

    ```python
    (x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
    assert x_train.shape == (60000, 28, 28)
    assert x_test.shape == (10000, 28, 28)
    assert y_train.shape == (60000,)
    assert y_test.shape == (10000,)
