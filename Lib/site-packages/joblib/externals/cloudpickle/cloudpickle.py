"""Pickler class to extend the standard pickle.Pickler functionality

The main objective is to make it natural to perform distributed computing on
clusters (such as PySpark, Dask, Ray...) with interactively defined code
(functions, classes, ...) written in notebooks or console.

In particular this pickler adds the following features:
- serialize interactively-defined or locally-defined functions, classes,
  enums, typevars, lambdas and nested functions to compiled byte code;
- deal with some other non-serializable objects in an ad-hoc manner where
  applicable.

This pickler is therefore meant to be used for the communication between short
lived Python processes running the same version of Python and libraries. In
particular, it is not meant to be used for long term storage of Python objects.

It does not include an unpickler, as standard Python unpickling suffices.

        def reducer_override(self, obj):
            """Type-agnostic reducing callback for function and classes.

            For performance reasons, subclasses of the C `pickle.Pickler` class
            cannot register custom reducers for functions and classes in the
            dispatch_table attribute. Reducers for such types must instead
            implemented via the special `reducer_override` method.

            Note that this method will be called for any object except a few
            builtin-types (int, lists, dicts etc.), which differs from reducers
            in the Pickler's dispatch_table, each of them being invoked for
            objects of a specific type only.

            This property comes in handy for classes: although most classes are
            instances of the ``type`` metaclass, some of them can be instances
            of other custom metaclasses (such as enum.EnumMeta for example). In
            particular, the metaclass will likely not be known in advance, and
            thus cannot be special-cased using an entry in the dispatch_table.
            reducer_override, among other things, allows us to register a
            reducer that will be called for any class, independently of its
            type.

            Notes:

            * reducer_override has the priority over dispatch_table-registered
            reducers.
            * reducer_override can be used to fix other limitations of
              cloudpickle for other types that suffered from type-specific
              reducers, such as Exceptions. See
              https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/issues/248
