    """An `EventMultiplexer` manages access to multiple `EventAccumulator`s.

    Each `EventAccumulator` is associated with a `run`, which is a self-contained
    TensorFlow execution. The `EventMultiplexer` provides methods for extracting
    information about events from multiple `run`s.

    Example usage for loading specific runs from files:

    ```python
    x = EventMultiplexer({'run1': 'path/to/run1', 'run2': 'path/to/run2'})
    x.Reload()
    ```

    Example usage for loading a directory where each subdirectory is a run

    ```python
    (eg:) /parent/directory/path/
          /parent/directory/path/run1/
          /parent/directory/path/run1/events.out.tfevents.1001
          /parent/directory/path/run1/events.out.tfevents.1002

          /parent/directory/path/run2/
          /parent/directory/path/run2/events.out.tfevents.9232

          /parent/directory/path/run3/
          /parent/directory/path/run3/events.out.tfevents.9232
    x = EventMultiplexer().AddRunsFromDirectory('/parent/directory/path')
    (which is equivalent to:)
    x = EventMultiplexer({'run1': '/parent/directory/path/run1', 'run2':...}
    ```

    If you would like to watch `/parent/directory/path`, wait for it to be created
      (if necessary) and then periodically pick up new runs, use
