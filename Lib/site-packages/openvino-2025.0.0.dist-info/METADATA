# OpenVINO™



Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit is an open-source toolkit for optimizing and deploying
AI inference. It can be used to develop applications and solutions based on deep learning tasks,
such as: emulation of human vision, automatic speech recognition, natural language processing,
recommendation systems, image generation, etc. It provides high-performance and rich deployment
options, from edge to cloud.

If you have chosen a model, you can integrate it with your application through OpenVINO™ and
deploy it on various devices. The OpenVINO™ Python package includes a set of libraries for easy
inference integration with your products.

## System Requirements

Before you start the installation, check the supported operating systems and required Python*
versions. The complete list of supported hardware is available on the
[System Requirements page](https://docs.openvino.ai/system_requirements).

**C++ libraries** are also required for the installation on Windows*. To install that, you can
[download the Visual Studio Redistributable file (.exe)](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).

> **NOTE**: This package may work on other Linux and Windows versions but only the versions specified in system requirements are fully validated.

## Install OpenVINO™

### Step 1. Set up Python virtual environment

Use a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts. To create a virtual environment, use
the following commands:

On Windows:
```sh
python -m venv openvino_env
```

On Linux and macOS:
```sh
python3 -m venv openvino_env
```

> **NOTE**: On Linux and macOS, you may need to [install pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

### Step 2. Activate the virtual environment

On Windows:
```sh
openvino_env\Scripts\activate
```

On Linux and macOS:
```sh
source openvino_env/bin/activate
```

### Step 3. Set up PIP and update it to the highest version

Run the command:
```sh
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

### Step 4. Install the package

Run the command:
```sh
pip install openvino
```

### Step 5. Verify that the package is installed

Run the command:
```sh
python -c "from openvino import Core; print(Core().available_devices)"
```

If installation was successful, you will see the list of available devices.

## Troubleshooting

For general troubleshooting, see the
[Troubleshooting Guide for OpenVINO Installation](https://docs.openvino.ai/2025/get-started/install-openvino/configurations/troubleshooting-install-config.html).
The following sections also provide explanations to several error messages.

### Errors with Installing via PIP for Users in China

Users in China may encounter errors while downloading sources via PIP during OpenVINO™ installation.
To resolve the issues, try the following solution:

* Add the download source using the ``-i`` parameter with the Python ``pip`` command. For example:

   ``` sh
   pip install openvino -i https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple/
   ```
   Use the ``--trusted-host`` parameter if the URL above is ``http`` instead of ``https``.

### ERROR:root:Could not find OpenVINO Python API.

On Windows, additional libraries may be necessary to run OpenVINO. To resolve this issue, install
the [C++ redistributable (.exe)](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).
You can also view a full download list on the
[official support page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist).

### ImportError: libpython3.10.so.1.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

To resolve missing external dependency on Ubuntu*, execute the following command:
```sh
sudo apt-get install libpython3.10
```
