    The grid is a cartesian product between the columns of ``values``. The

def _partial_dependence_recursion(est, grid, features):

    The recursion method is in particular enabled for tree-based estimators.

    For each `grid` value, a weighted tree traversal is performed: if a split node
    involves an input feature of interest, the corresponding left or right branch
    is followed; otherwise both branches are followed, each branch being weighted
    by the fraction of training samples that entered that branch. Finally, the
    partial dependence is given by a weighted average of all the visited leaves
    values.

    This method is more efficient in terms of speed than the `'brute'` method
    (:func:`~sklearn.inspection._partial_dependence._partial_dependence_brute`).
    However, here, the partial dependence computation is done explicitly with the
    `X` used during training of `est`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    est : BaseEstimator
        A fitted estimator object implementing :term:`predict` or
        :term:`decision_function`. Multioutput-multiclass classifiers are not
        supported. Note that `'recursion'` is only supported for some tree-based

        :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor`,
        ).

    grid : array-like of shape (n_points, n_target_features)
        The grid of feature values for which the partial dependence is calculated.
        Note that `n_points` is the number of points in the grid and `n_target_features`
        is the number of features you are doing partial dependence at.

    features : array-like of {int, str}
        The feature (e.g. `[0]`) or pair of interacting features
        (e.g. `[(0, 1)]`) for which the partial dependency should be computed.

    Returns
    -------
    averaged_predictions : array-like of shape (n_targets, n_points)
        The averaged predictions for the given `grid` of features values.
        Note that `n_targets` is the number of targets (e.g. 1 for binary
        classification, `n_tasks` for multi-output regression, and `n_classes` for
        multiclass classification) and `n_points` is the number of points in the `grid`.

def _partial_dependence_brute(
    est, grid, features, X, response_method, sample_weight=None
):
    """Calculate partial dependence via the brute force method.

    The brute method explicitly averages the predictions of an estimator over a
    grid of feature values.

    For each `grid` value, all the samples from `X` have their variables of
    interest replaced by that specific `grid` value. The predictions are then made
    and averaged across the samples.

    This method is slower than the `'recursion'`
    (:func:`~sklearn.inspection._partial_dependence._partial_dependence_recursion`)
    version for estimators with this second option. However, with the `'brute'`
    force method, the average will be done with the given `X` and not the `X`
    used during training, as it is done in the `'recursion'` version. Therefore
    the average can always accept `sample_weight` (even when the estimator was
    fitted without).

    Parameters
    ----------
    est : BaseEstimator
        A fitted estimator object implementing :term:`predict`,
        :term:`predict_proba`, or :term:`decision_function`.
        Multioutput-multiclass classifiers are not supported.

    grid : array-like of shape (n_points, n_target_features)
        The grid of feature values for which the partial dependence is calculated.
        Note that `n_points` is the number of points in the grid and `n_target_features`
        is the number of features you are doing partial dependence at.

    features : array-like of {int, str}
        The feature (e.g. `[0]`) or pair of interacting features
        (e.g. `[(0, 1)]`) for which the partial dependency should be computed.

    X : array-like of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        `X` is used to generate values for the complement features. That is, for
        each value in `grid`, the method will average the prediction of each
        sample from `X` having that grid value for `features`.

    response_method : {'auto', 'predict_proba', 'decision_function'}, \
            default='auto'
        Specifies whether to use :term:`predict_proba` or
        :term:`decision_function` as the target response. For regressors
        this parameter is ignored and the response is always the output of
        :term:`predict`. By default, :term:`predict_proba` is tried first
        and we revert to :term:`decision_function` if it doesn't exist.

    sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
        Sample weights are used to calculate weighted means when averaging the
        model output. If `None`, then samples are equally weighted. Note that
        `sample_weight` does not change the individual predictions.

    Returns
    -------
    averaged_predictions : array-like of shape (n_targets, n_points)
        The averaged predictions for the given `grid` of features values.
        Note that `n_targets` is the number of targets (e.g. 1 for binary
        classification, `n_tasks` for multi-output regression, and `n_classes` for
        multiclass classification) and `n_points` is the number of points in the `grid`.

    predictions : array-like
        The predictions for the given `grid` of features values over the samples
        from `X`. For non-multioutput regression and binary classification the
        shape is `(n_instances, n_points)` and for multi-output regression and
        multiclass classification the shape is `(n_targets, n_instances, n_points)`,
        where `n_targets` is the number of targets (`n_tasks` for multi-output
        regression, and `n_classes` for multiclass classification), `n_instances`
        is the number of instances in `X`, and `n_points` is the number of points

    .. warning::

        For :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier` and
        :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor`, the
        `'recursion'` method (used by default) will not account for the `init`
        predictor of the boosting process. In practice, this will produce
        the same values as `'brute'` up to a constant offset in the target
        response, provided that `init` is a constant estimator (which is the
        default). However, if `init` is not a constant estimator, the
        partial dependence values are incorrect for `'recursion'` because the
        offset will be sample-dependent. It is preferable to use the `'brute'`
        method. Note that this only applies to
        :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier` and
        :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor`, not to
        :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingClassifier` and
        :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingRegressor`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator : BaseEstimator
        A fitted estimator object implementing :term:`predict`,
        :term:`predict_proba`, or :term:`decision_function`.
        Multioutput-multiclass classifiers are not supported.

    X : {array-like, sparse matrix or dataframe} of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        ``X`` is used to generate a grid of values for the target
        ``features`` (where the partial dependence will be evaluated), and
        also to generate values for the complement features when the
        `method` is 'brute'.

    features : array-like of {int, str, bool} or int or str
        The feature (e.g. `[0]`) or pair of interacting features
        (e.g. `[(0, 1)]`) for which the partial dependency should be computed.

    sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
        Sample weights are used to calculate weighted means when averaging the
        model output. If `None`, then samples are equally weighted. If
        `sample_weight` is not `None`, then `method` will be set to `'brute'`.
        Note that `sample_weight` is ignored for `kind='individual'`.

        .. versionadded:: 1.3

    categorical_features : array-like of shape (n_features,) or shape \
            (n_categorical_features,), dtype={bool, int, str}, default=None
        Indicates the categorical features.

        - `None`: no feature will be considered categorical;
        - boolean array-like: boolean mask of shape `(n_features,)`
            indicating which features are categorical. Thus, this array has
            the same shape has `X.shape[1]`;
        - integer or string array-like: integer indices or strings
            indicating categorical features.

        .. versionadded:: 1.2

    feature_names : array-like of shape (n_features,), dtype=str, default=None
        Name of each feature; `feature_names[i]` holds the name of the feature
        with index `i`.
        By default, the name of the feature corresponds to their numerical
        index for NumPy array and their column name for pandas dataframe.

        .. versionadded:: 1.2

    response_method : {'auto', 'predict_proba', 'decision_function'}, \
            default='auto'
        Specifies whether to use :term:`predict_proba` or
        :term:`decision_function` as the target response. For regressors
        this parameter is ignored and the response is always the output of
        :term:`predict`. By default, :term:`predict_proba` is tried first
        and we revert to :term:`decision_function` if it doesn't exist. If
        ``method`` is 'recursion', the response is always the output of
        :term:`decision_function`.

    percentiles : tuple of float, default=(0.05, 0.95)
        The lower and upper percentile used to create the extreme values
        for the grid. Must be in [0, 1].

    grid_resolution : int, default=100
        The number of equally spaced points on the grid, for each target
        feature.

    method : {'auto', 'recursion', 'brute'}, default='auto'
        The method used to calculate the averaged predictions:

        - `'recursion'` is only supported for some tree-based estimators
          (namely
          :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier`,
          :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor`,
          :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingClassifier`,
          :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingRegressor`,
          :class:`~sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor`,
          :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor`,
          ) when `kind='average'`.
          This is more efficient in terms of speed.
          With this method, the target response of a
          classifier is always the decision function, not the predicted
          probabilities. Since the `'recursion'` method implicitly computes
          the average of the Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) by
          design, it is not compatible with ICE and thus `kind` must be
          `'average'`.

        - `'brute'` is supported for any estimator, but is more
          computationally intensive.

        - `'auto'`: the `'recursion'` is used for estimators that support it,
          and `'brute'` is used otherwise. If `sample_weight` is not `None`,
          then `'brute'` is used regardless of the estimator.

        Please see :ref:`this note <pdp_method_differences>` for
        differences between the `'brute'` and `'recursion'` method.

    kind : {'average', 'individual', 'both'}, default='average'
        Whether to return the partial dependence averaged across all the
        samples in the dataset or one value per sample or both.
        See Returns below.

        Note that the fast `method='recursion'` option is only available for
        `kind='average'` and `sample_weights=None`. Computing individual
        dependencies and doing weighted averages requires using the slower
        `method='brute'`.

            The values with which the grid has been created. The generated
            grid is a cartesian product of the arrays in `grid_values` where
            `len(grid_values) == len(features)`. The size of each array
            `grid_values[j]` is either `grid_resolution`, or the number of
            unique values in `X[:, j]`, whichever is smaller.

            .. versionadded:: 1.3

        `n_outputs` corresponds to the number of classes in a multi-class
        setting, or to the number of tasks for multi-output regression.
        For classical regression and binary classification `n_outputs==1`.
        `n_values_feature_j` corresponds to the size `grid_values[j]`.
