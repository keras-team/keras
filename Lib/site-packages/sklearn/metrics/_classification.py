    sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
        Sample weights.

    labels : array-like of shape (n_classes,), default=None
        A list of classes or column indices to select some (or to force
        inclusion of classes absent from the data).

    samplewise : bool, default=False

    Returns
    -------
    multi_confusion : ndarray of shape (n_outputs, 2, 2)
        A 2x2 confusion matrix corresponding to each output in the input.
        When calculating class-wise multi_confusion (default), then
        n_outputs = n_labels; when calculating sample-wise multi_confusion
        (samplewise=True), n_outputs = n_samples. If ``labels`` is defined,
        the results will be returned in the order specified in ``labels``,
        otherwise the results will be returned in sorted order by default.

    Notes
    -----
    The `multilabel_confusion_matrix` calculates class-wise or sample-wise
    multilabel confusion matrices, and in multiclass tasks, labels are
    binarized under a one-vs-rest way; while

    r"""Compute Cohen's kappa: a statistic that measures inter-annotator agreement.

    This function computes Cohen's kappa [1]_, a score that expresses the level
    of agreement between two annotators on a classification problem. It is
    defined as

    .. math::
        \kappa = (p_o - p_e) / (1 - p_e)

    where :math:`p_o` is the empirical probability of agreement on the label
    assigned to any sample (the observed agreement ratio), and :math:`p_e` is
    the expected agreement when both annotators assign labels randomly.
    :math:`p_e` is estimated using a per-annotator empirical prior over the
    class labels [2]_.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <cohen_kappa>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y1 : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        Labels assigned by the first annotator.

    y2 : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        Labels assigned by the second annotator. The kappa statistic is
        symmetric, so swapping ``y1`` and ``y2`` doesn't change the value.

    labels : array-like of shape (n_classes,), default=None
        List of labels to index the matrix. This may be used to select a
        subset of labels. If `None`, all labels that appear at least once in
        ``y1`` or ``y2`` are used.

    weights : {'linear', 'quadratic'}, default=None
        Weighting type to calculate the score. `None` means not weighted;
        "linear" means linear weighting; "quadratic" means quadratic weighting.

    sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
        Sample weights.

    Returns
    -------
    kappa : float
        The kappa statistic, which is a number between -1 and 1. The maximum
        value means complete agreement; zero or lower means chance agreement.

    """Jaccard similarity coefficient score.

    The Jaccard index [1], or Jaccard similarity coefficient, defined as
    the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of two label
    sets, is used to compare set of predicted labels for a sample to the
    corresponding set of labels in ``y_true``.

    Support beyond term:`binary` targets is achieved by treating :term:`multiclass`
    and :term:`multilabel` data as a collection of binary problems, one for each
    label. For the :term:`binary` case, setting `average='binary'` will return the
    Jaccard similarity coefficient for `pos_label`. If `average` is not `'binary'`,
    `pos_label` is ignored and scores for both classes are computed, then averaged or
    both returned (when `average=None`). Similarly, for :term:`multiclass` and
    :term:`multilabel` targets, scores for all `labels` are either returned or
    averaged depending on the `average` parameter. Use `labels` specify the set of
    labels to calculate the score for.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <jaccard_similarity_score>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : 1d array-like, or label indicator array / sparse matrix
        Ground truth (correct) labels.

    y_pred : 1d array-like, or label indicator array / sparse matrix
        Predicted labels, as returned by a classifier.

    labels : array-like of shape (n_classes,), default=None
        The set of labels to include when `average != 'binary'`, and their
        order if `average is None`. Labels present in the data can be
        excluded, for example in multiclass classification to exclude a "negative
        class". Labels not present in the data can be included and will be
        "assigned" 0 samples. For multilabel targets, labels are column indices.
        By default, all labels in `y_true` and `y_pred` are used in sorted order.

    pos_label : int, float, bool or str, default=1
        The class to report if `average='binary'` and the data is binary,
        otherwise this parameter is ignored.
        For multiclass or multilabel targets, set `labels=[pos_label]` and
        `average != 'binary'` to report metrics for one label only.

    average : {'micro', 'macro', 'samples', 'weighted', \
            'binary'} or None, default='binary'
        If ``None``, the scores for each class are returned. Otherwise, this
        determines the type of averaging performed on the data:

        ``'binary'``:
            Only report results for the class specified by ``pos_label``.
            This is applicable only if targets (``y_{true,pred}``) are binary.
        ``'micro'``:
            Calculate metrics globally by counting the total true positives,
            false negatives and false positives.
        ``'macro'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their unweighted
            mean.  This does not take label imbalance into account.
        ``'weighted'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their average, weighted
            by support (the number of true instances for each label). This
            alters 'macro' to account for label imbalance.
        ``'samples'``:
            Calculate metrics for each instance, and find their average (only
            meaningful for multilabel classification).

    sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
        Sample weights.

    zero_division : "warn", {0.0, 1.0}, default="warn"
        Sets the value to return when there is a zero division, i.e. when there
        there are no negative values in predictions and labels. If set to
        "warn", this acts like 0, but a warning is also raised.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    Returns
    -------
    score : float or ndarray of shape (n_unique_labels,), dtype=np.float64
        The Jaccard score. When `average` is not `None`, a single scalar is
        returned.

    See Also
    --------
    accuracy_score : Function for calculating the accuracy score.

    multilabel_confusion_matrix : Function for computing a confusion matrix\
                                  for each class or sample.

    Notes
    -----
    :func:`jaccard_score` may be a poor metric if there are no
    positives for some samples or classes. Jaccard is undefined if there are
    no true or predicted labels, and our implementation will return a score
    of 0 with a warning.

    The Matthews correlation coefficient is used in machine learning as a

    Returns
    -------
    loss : float or int,
        If ``normalize == True``, return the fraction of misclassifications
        (float), else it returns the number of misclassifications (int).

    --------
    accuracy_score : Compute the accuracy score. By default, the function will
        return the fraction of correct predictions divided by the total number
        of predictions.
    hamming_loss : Compute the average Hamming loss or Hamming distance between
        two sets of samples.
    jaccard_score : Compute the Jaccard similarity coefficient score.

    Notes
    -----
    In multilabel classification, the zero_one_loss function corresponds to
    the subset zero-one loss: for each sample, the entire set of labels must be
    correctly predicted, otherwise the loss for that sample is equal to one.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from sklearn.metrics import zero_one_loss
    >>> y_pred = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    >>> y_true = [2, 2, 3, 4]
    >>> zero_one_loss(y_true, y_pred)
    0.25
    >>> zero_one_loss(y_true, y_pred, normalize=False)
    1.0

    In the multilabel case with binary label indicators:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> zero_one_loss(np.array([[0, 1], [1, 1]]), np.ones((2, 2)))

    """Compute the F1 score, also known as balanced F-score or F-measure.

    The F1 score can be interpreted as a harmonic mean of the precision and
    recall, where an F1 score reaches its best value at 1 and worst score at 0.
    The relative contribution of precision and recall to the F1 score are
    equal. The formula for the F1 score is:

    .. math::
        \\text{F1} = \\frac{2 * \\text{TP}}{2 * \\text{TP} + \\text{FP} + \\text{FN}}

    Where :math:`\\text{TP}` is the number of true positives, :math:`\\text{FN}` is the
    number of false negatives, and :math:`\\text{FP}` is the number of false positives.
    F1 is by default
    calculated as 0.0 when there are no true positives, false negatives, or
    false positives.

    Support beyond :term:`binary` targets is achieved by treating :term:`multiclass`
    and :term:`multilabel` data as a collection of binary problems, one for each
    label. For the :term:`binary` case, setting `average='binary'` will return
    F1 score for `pos_label`. If `average` is not `'binary'`, `pos_label` is ignored
    and F1 score for both classes are computed, then averaged or both returned (when
    `average=None`). Similarly, for :term:`multiclass` and :term:`multilabel` targets,
    F1 score for all `labels` are either returned or averaged depending on the
    `average` parameter. Use `labels` specify the set of labels to calculate F1 score
    for.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <precision_recall_f_measure_metrics>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : 1d array-like, or label indicator array / sparse matrix
        Ground truth (correct) target values.

    y_pred : 1d array-like, or label indicator array / sparse matrix
        Estimated targets as returned by a classifier.

    labels : array-like, default=None
        The set of labels to include when `average != 'binary'`, and their
        order if `average is None`. Labels present in the data can be
        excluded, for example in multiclass classification to exclude a "negative
        class". Labels not present in the data can be included and will be
        "assigned" 0 samples. For multilabel targets, labels are column indices.
        By default, all labels in `y_true` and `y_pred` are used in sorted order.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.17
           Parameter `labels` improved for multiclass problem.

    pos_label : int, float, bool or str, default=1
        The class to report if `average='binary'` and the data is binary,
        otherwise this parameter is ignored.
        For multiclass or multilabel targets, set `labels=[pos_label]` and
        `average != 'binary'` to report metrics for one label only.

    average : {'micro', 'macro', 'samples', 'weighted', 'binary'} or None, \
            default='binary'
        This parameter is required for multiclass/multilabel targets.
        If ``None``, the metrics for each class are returned. Otherwise, this
        determines the type of averaging performed on the data:

        ``'binary'``:
            Only report results for the class specified by ``pos_label``.
            This is applicable only if targets (``y_{true,pred}``) are binary.
        ``'micro'``:
            Calculate metrics globally by counting the total true positives,
            false negatives and false positives.
        ``'macro'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their unweighted
            mean.  This does not take label imbalance into account.
        ``'weighted'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their average weighted
            by support (the number of true instances for each label). This
            alters 'macro' to account for label imbalance; it can result in an
            F-score that is not between precision and recall.
        ``'samples'``:
            Calculate metrics for each instance, and find their average (only
            meaningful for multilabel classification where this differs from
            :func:`accuracy_score`).

    sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
        Sample weights.

    zero_division : {"warn", 0.0, 1.0, np.nan}, default="warn"
        Sets the value to return when there is a zero division, i.e. when all
        predictions and labels are negative.

        Notes:
        - If set to "warn", this acts like 0, but a warning is also raised.
        - If set to `np.nan`, such values will be excluded from the average.

        .. versionadded:: 1.3
           `np.nan` option was added.

    Returns
    -------
    f1_score : float or array of float, shape = [n_unique_labels]
        F1 score of the positive class in binary classification or weighted
        average of the F1 scores of each class for the multiclass task.

    See Also
    --------
    fbeta_score : Compute the F-beta score.
    precision_recall_fscore_support : Compute the precision, recall, F-score,
        and support.
    jaccard_score : Compute the Jaccard similarity coefficient score.
    multilabel_confusion_matrix : Compute a confusion matrix for each class or
        sample.

    Notes
    -----
    When ``true positive + false positive + false negative == 0`` (i.e. a class
    is completely absent from both ``y_true`` or ``y_pred``), f-score is
    undefined. In such cases, by default f-score will be set to 0.0, and
    ``UndefinedMetricWarning`` will be raised. This behavior can be modified by
    setting the ``zero_division`` parameter.

    """Compute the F-beta score.

    The F-beta score is the weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall,
    reaching its optimal value at 1 and its worst value at 0.

    The `beta` parameter represents the ratio of recall importance to
    precision importance. `beta > 1` gives more weight to recall, while
    `beta < 1` favors precision. For example, `beta = 2` makes recall twice
    as important as precision, while `beta = 0.5` does the opposite.
    Asymptotically, `beta -> +inf` considers only recall, and `beta -> 0`
    only precision.

    The formula for F-beta score is:

    .. math::

       F_\\beta = \\frac{(1 + \\beta^2) \\text{tp}}
                        {(1 + \\beta^2) \\text{tp} + \\text{fp} + \\beta^2 \\text{fn}}

    Where :math:`\\text{tp}` is the number of true positives, :math:`\\text{fp}` is the
    number of false positives, and :math:`\\text{fn}` is the number of false negatives.

    Support beyond term:`binary` targets is achieved by treating :term:`multiclass`
    and :term:`multilabel` data as a collection of binary problems, one for each
    label. For the :term:`binary` case, setting `average='binary'` will return
    F-beta score for `pos_label`. If `average` is not `'binary'`, `pos_label` is
    ignored and F-beta score for both classes are computed, then averaged or both
    returned (when `average=None`). Similarly, for :term:`multiclass` and
    :term:`multilabel` targets, F-beta score for all `labels` are either returned or
    averaged depending on the `average` parameter. Use `labels` specify the set of
    labels to calculate F-beta score for.

    """Compute precision, recall, F-measure and support for each class.

    The precision is the ratio ``tp / (tp + fp)`` where ``tp`` is the number of
    true positives and ``fp`` the number of false positives. The precision is
    intuitively the ability of the classifier not to label a negative sample as
    positive.

    The recall is the ratio ``tp / (tp + fn)`` where ``tp`` is the number of
    true positives and ``fn`` the number of false negatives. The recall is
    intuitively the ability of the classifier to find all the positive samples.

    The F-beta score can be interpreted as a weighted harmonic mean of
    the precision and recall, where an F-beta score reaches its best
    value at 1 and worst score at 0.

    The F-beta score weights recall more than precision by a factor of
    ``beta``. ``beta == 1.0`` means recall and precision are equally important.

    The support is the number of occurrences of each class in ``y_true``.

    Support beyond term:`binary` targets is achieved by treating :term:`multiclass`
    and :term:`multilabel` data as a collection of binary problems, one for each
    label. For the :term:`binary` case, setting `average='binary'` will return
    metrics for `pos_label`. If `average` is not `'binary'`, `pos_label` is ignored
    and metrics for both classes are computed, then averaged or both returned (when
    `average=None`). Similarly, for :term:`multiclass` and :term:`multilabel` targets,
    metrics for all `labels` are either returned or averaged depending on the `average`
    parameter. Use `labels` specify the set of labels to calculate metrics for.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <precision_recall_f_measure_metrics>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : 1d array-like, or label indicator array / sparse matrix
        Ground truth (correct) target values.

    y_pred : 1d array-like, or label indicator array / sparse matrix
        Estimated targets as returned by a classifier.

    beta : float, default=1.0
        The strength of recall versus precision in the F-score.

    labels : array-like, default=None
        The set of labels to include when `average != 'binary'`, and their
        order if `average is None`. Labels present in the data can be
        excluded, for example in multiclass classification to exclude a "negative
        class". Labels not present in the data can be included and will be
        "assigned" 0 samples. For multilabel targets, labels are column indices.
        By default, all labels in `y_true` and `y_pred` are used in sorted order.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.17
           Parameter `labels` improved for multiclass problem.

    pos_label : int, float, bool or str, default=1
        The class to report if `average='binary'` and the data is binary,
        otherwise this parameter is ignored.
        For multiclass or multilabel targets, set `labels=[pos_label]` and
        `average != 'binary'` to report metrics for one label only.

    average : {'micro', 'macro', 'samples', 'weighted', 'binary'} or None, \
            default='binary'
        This parameter is required for multiclass/multilabel targets.
        If ``None``, the metrics for each class are returned. Otherwise, this
        determines the type of averaging performed on the data:

        ``'binary'``:
            Only report results for the class specified by ``pos_label``.
            This is applicable only if targets (``y_{true,pred}``) are binary.
        ``'micro'``:
            Calculate metrics globally by counting the total true positives,
            false negatives and false positives.
        ``'macro'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their unweighted
            mean.  This does not take label imbalance into account.
        ``'weighted'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their average weighted
            by support (the number of true instances for each label). This
            alters 'macro' to account for label imbalance; it can result in an
            F-score that is not between precision and recall.
        ``'samples'``:
            Calculate metrics for each instance, and find their average (only
            meaningful for multilabel classification where this differs from
            :func:`accuracy_score`).

    warn_for : list, tuple or set, for internal use
        This determines which warnings will be made in the case that this
        function is being used to return only one of its metrics.

    sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
        Sample weights.

    zero_division : {"warn", 0.0, 1.0, np.nan}, default="warn"
        Sets the value to return when there is a zero division:

        - recall: when there are no positive labels
        - precision: when there are no positive predictions
        - f-score: both

        Notes:

        - If set to "warn", this acts like 0, but a warning is also raised.
        - If set to `np.nan`, such values will be excluded from the average.

        .. versionadded:: 1.3
           `np.nan` option was added.

    Returns
    -------
    precision : float (if average is not None) or array of float, shape =\
        [n_unique_labels]
        Precision score.

    recall : float (if average is not None) or array of float, shape =\
        [n_unique_labels]
        Recall score.

    fbeta_score : float (if average is not None) or array of float, shape =\
        [n_unique_labels]
        F-beta score.

    support : None (if average is not None) or array of int, shape =\
        [n_unique_labels]
        The number of occurrences of each label in ``y_true``.

    Notes
    -----
    When ``true positive + false positive == 0``, precision is undefined.
    When ``true positive + false negative == 0``, recall is undefined. When
    ``true positive + false negative + false positive == 0``, f-score is
    undefined. In such cases, by default the metric will be set to 0, and
    ``UndefinedMetricWarning`` will be raised. This behavior can be modified
    with ``zero_division``.

    """Compute binary classification positive and negative likelihood ratios.

    The positive likelihood ratio is `LR+ = sensitivity / (1 - specificity)`
    where the sensitivity or recall is the ratio `tp / (tp + fn)` and the
    specificity is `tn / (tn + fp)`. The negative likelihood ratio is `LR- = (1
    - sensitivity) / specificity`. Here `tp` is the number of true positives,
    `fp` the number of false positives, `tn` is the number of true negatives and
    `fn` the number of false negatives. Both class likelihood ratios can be used
    to obtain post-test probabilities given a pre-test probability.

    `LR+` ranges from 1 to infinity. A `LR+` of 1 indicates that the probability
    of predicting the positive class is the same for samples belonging to either
    class; therefore, the test is useless. The greater `LR+` is, the more a
    positive prediction is likely to be a true positive when compared with the
    pre-test probability. A value of `LR+` lower than 1 is invalid as it would
    indicate that the odds of a sample being a true positive decrease with
    respect to the pre-test odds.

    `LR-` ranges from 0 to 1. The closer it is to 0, the lower the probability
    of a given sample to be a false negative. A `LR-` of 1 means the test is
    useless because the odds of having the condition did not change after the
    test. A value of `LR-` greater than 1 invalidates the classifier as it
    indicates an increase in the odds of a sample belonging to the positive
    class after being classified as negative. This is the case when the
    classifier systematically predicts the opposite of the true label.

    A typical application in medicine is to identify the positive/negative class
    to the presence/absence of a disease, respectively; the classifier being a
    diagnostic test; the pre-test probability of an individual having the
    disease can be the prevalence of such disease (proportion of a particular
    population found to be affected by a medical condition); and the post-test
    probabilities would be the probability that the condition is truly present
    given a positive test result.

    labels : array-like, default=None
        List of labels to index the matrix. This may be used to select the
        positive and negative classes with the ordering `labels=[negative_class,
        positive_class]`. If `None` is given, those that appear at least once in
        `y_true` or `y_pred` are used in sorted order.

    sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
        Sample weights.

    raise_warning : bool, default=True
        Whether or not a case-specific warning message is raised when there is a
        zero division. Even if the error is not raised, the function will return
        nan in such cases.

    Returns
    -------
    (positive_likelihood_ratio, negative_likelihood_ratio) : tuple
        A tuple of two float, the first containing the Positive likelihood ratio
        and the second the Negative likelihood ratio.

    Warns
    -----
    When `false positive == 0`, the positive likelihood ratio is undefined.
    When `true negative == 0`, the negative likelihood ratio is undefined.
    When `true positive + false negative == 0` both ratios are undefined.
    In such cases, `UserWarning` will be raised if raise_warning=True.

    `average` parameter. Use `labels` specify the set of labels to calculate precision
    for.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <precision_recall_f_measure_metrics>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : 1d array-like, or label indicator array / sparse matrix
        Ground truth (correct) target values.

    y_pred : 1d array-like, or label indicator array / sparse matrix
        Estimated targets as returned by a classifier.

    labels : array-like, default=None
        The set of labels to include when `average != 'binary'`, and their
        order if `average is None`. Labels present in the data can be
        excluded, for example in multiclass classification to exclude a "negative
        class". Labels not present in the data can be included and will be
        "assigned" 0 samples. For multilabel targets, labels are column indices.
        By default, all labels in `y_true` and `y_pred` are used in sorted order.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.17
           Parameter `labels` improved for multiclass problem.

    pos_label : int, float, bool or str, default=1
        The class to report if `average='binary'` and the data is binary,
        otherwise this parameter is ignored.
        For multiclass or multilabel targets, set `labels=[pos_label]` and
        `average != 'binary'` to report metrics for one label only.

    average : {'micro', 'macro', 'samples', 'weighted', 'binary'} or None, \
            default='binary'
        This parameter is required for multiclass/multilabel targets.
        If ``None``, the metrics for each class are returned. Otherwise, this
        determines the type of averaging performed on the data:

        ``'binary'``:
            Only report results for the class specified by ``pos_label``.
            This is applicable only if targets (``y_{true,pred}``) are binary.
        ``'micro'``:
            Calculate metrics globally by counting the total true positives,
            false negatives and false positives.
        ``'macro'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their unweighted
            mean.  This does not take label imbalance into account.
        ``'weighted'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their average weighted
            by support (the number of true instances for each label). This
            alters 'macro' to account for label imbalance; it can result in an
            F-score that is not between precision and recall.
        ``'samples'``:
            Calculate metrics for each instance, and find their average (only
            meaningful for multilabel classification where this differs from
            :func:`accuracy_score`).

    sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
        Sample weights.

    zero_division : {"warn", 0.0, 1.0, np.nan}, default="warn"
        Sets the value to return when there is a zero division.

        Notes:

        - If set to "warn", this acts like 0, but a warning is also raised.
        - If set to `np.nan`, such values will be excluded from the average.

        .. versionadded:: 1.3
           `np.nan` option was added.

    Returns
    -------
    precision : float (if average is not None) or array of float of shape \
                (n_unique_labels,)
        Precision of the positive class in binary classification or weighted
        average of the precision of each class for the multiclass task.

    See Also
    --------
    precision_recall_fscore_support : Compute precision, recall, F-measure and
        support for each class.
    recall_score :  Compute the ratio ``tp / (tp + fn)`` where ``tp`` is the
        number of true positives and ``fn`` the number of false negatives.
    PrecisionRecallDisplay.from_estimator : Plot precision-recall curve given
        an estimator and some data.
    PrecisionRecallDisplay.from_predictions : Plot precision-recall curve given
        binary class predictions.
    multilabel_confusion_matrix : Compute a confusion matrix for each class or
        sample.

    Notes
    -----
    When ``true positive + false positive == 0``, precision returns 0 and
    raises ``UndefinedMetricWarning``. This behavior can be
    modified with ``zero_division``.

    The recall is the ratio ``tp / (tp + fn)`` where ``tp`` is the number of

    Support beyond term:`binary` targets is achieved by treating :term:`multiclass`
    and :term:`multilabel` data as a collection of binary problems, one for each

    Returns
    -------
    report : str or dict
        Text summary of the precision, recall, F1 score for each class.
        Dictionary returned if output_dict is True. Dictionary has the
        following structure::

            {'label 1': {'precision':0.5,

             'label 2': { ... },
              ...
            }

        The reported averages include macro average (averaging the unweighted
        mean per label), weighted average (averaging the support-weighted mean
        per label), and sample average (only for multilabel classification).
        Micro average (averaging the total true positives, false negatives and
        false positives) is only shown for multi-label or multi-class
        with a subset of classes, because it corresponds to accuracy
        otherwise and would be the same for all metrics.
        See also :func:`precision_recall_fscore_support` for more details
        on averages.

        Note that in binary classification, recall of the positive class
        is also known as "sensitivity"; recall of the negative class is
        "specificity".

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : 1d array-like, or label indicator array / sparse matrix
        Ground truth (correct) labels.

    y_pred : 1d array-like, or label indicator array / sparse matrix
        Predicted labels, as returned by a classifier.

    sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
        Sample weights.

        .. versionadded:: 0.18

    Returns
    -------
    loss : float or int
        Return the average Hamming loss between element of ``y_true`` and
        ``y_pred``.

    See Also
    --------
    accuracy_score : Compute the accuracy score. By default, the function will
        return the fraction of correct predictions divided by the total number
        of predictions.
    jaccard_score : Compute the Jaccard similarity coefficient score.
    zero_one_loss : Compute the Zero-one classification loss. By default, the
        function will return the percentage of imperfectly predicted subsets.

    Notes
    -----
    In multiclass classification, the Hamming loss corresponds to the Hamming
    distance between ``y_true`` and ``y_pred`` which is equivalent to the
    subset ``zero_one_loss`` function, when `normalize` parameter is set to
    True.

    In multilabel classification, the Hamming loss is different from the
    subset zero-one loss. The zero-one loss considers the entire set of labels
    for a given sample incorrect if it does not entirely match the true set of
    labels. Hamming loss is more forgiving in that it penalizes only the
    individual labels.

    The Hamming loss is upperbounded by the subset zero-one loss, when
    `normalize` parameter is set to True. It is always between 0 and 1,
    lower being better.

    This is the loss function used in (multinomial) logistic regression
    and extensions of it such as neural networks, defined as the negative
    log-likelihood of a logistic model that returns ``y_pred`` probabilities
    for its training data ``y_true``.
    The log loss is only defined for two or more labels.
    For a single sample with true label :math:`y \in \{0,1\}` and

    loss is:

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : array-like or label indicator matrix

    y_pred : array-like of float, shape = (n_samples, n_classes) or (n_samples,)
        Predicted probabilities, as returned by a classifier's

        `y_pred` values are clipped to `[eps, 1-eps]` where `eps` is the machine
        precision for `y_pred`'s dtype.

    normalize : bool, default=True
        If true, return the mean loss per sample.
        Otherwise, return the sum of the per-sample losses.

    sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
        Sample weights.

    labels : array-like, default=None
        If not provided, labels will be inferred from y_true. If ``labels``

    """Compute the Brier score loss.

    The smaller the Brier score loss, the better, hence the naming with "loss".
    The Brier score measures the mean squared difference between the predicted
    probability and the actual outcome. The Brier score always
    takes on a value between zero and one, since this is the largest
    possible difference between a predicted probability (which must be
    between zero and one) and the actual outcome (which can take on values
    of only 0 and 1). It can be decomposed as the sum of refinement loss and
    calibration loss.

    The Brier score is appropriate for binary and categorical outcomes that
    can be structured as true or false, but is inappropriate for ordinal
    variables which can take on three or more values (this is because the
    Brier score assumes that all possible outcomes are equivalently
    "distant" from one another). Which label is considered to be the positive
    label is controlled via the parameter `pos_label`, which defaults to
    the greater label unless `y_true` is all 0 or all -1, in which case
    `pos_label` defaults to 1.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <brier_score_loss>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        True targets.

    y_proba : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        Probabilities of the positive class.

    sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
        Sample weights.

    pos_label : int, float, bool or str, default=None
        Label of the positive class. `pos_label` will be inferred in the
        following manner:

        * if `y_true` in {-1, 1} or {0, 1}, `pos_label` defaults to 1;
        * else if `y_true` contains string, an error will be raised and
          `pos_label` should be explicitly specified;
        * otherwise, `pos_label` defaults to the greater label,
          i.e. `np.unique(y_true)[-1]`.

    y_prob : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        Probabilities of the positive class.

        .. deprecated:: 1.5
            `y_prob` is deprecated and will be removed in 1.7. Use
            `y_proba` instead.

    Returns
    -------
    score : float
        Brier score loss.

    y_true : array-like or label indicator matrix
        The actuals labels for the n_samples samples.
