      >>> adjusted_rand_score([0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 2])
      0.57...

    If classes members are completely split across different clusters, the

    ARI may take a negative value for especially discordant labelings that

    A clustering result satisfies completeness if all the data points
    that are members of a given class are elements of the same cluster.

    This metric is independent of the absolute values of the labels:
    a permutation of the class or cluster label values won't change the
    score value in any way.

    This metric is not symmetric: switching ``label_true`` with ``label_pred``
    will return the :func:`homogeneity_score` which will be different in
    general.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <homogeneity_completeness>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    labels_true : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        Ground truth class labels to be used as a reference.

    labels_pred : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        Cluster labels to evaluate.

    Returns
    -------
    completeness : float
       Score between 0.0 and 1.0. 1.0 stands for perfectly complete labeling.

      0.66...

    Labelings that have pure clusters with members coming from the same
    classes are homogeneous but un-necessary splits harm completeness
    and thus penalize V-measure as well::

      >>> print("%.6f" % v_measure_score([0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 2]))
      0.8...
      >>> print("%.6f" % v_measure_score([0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 1, 2, 3]))

    If classes members are completely split across different clusters,

    --------

    Perfect labelings are both homogeneous and complete, hence have
    score 1.0::

      >>> from sklearn.metrics.cluster import fowlkes_mallows_score
      >>> fowlkes_mallows_score([0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1])
      np.float64(1.0)
      >>> fowlkes_mallows_score([0, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0, 0])
      np.float64(1.0)

    If classes members are completely split across different clusters,
    the assignment is totally random, hence the FMI is null::

      >>> fowlkes_mallows_score([0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3])
      0.0
