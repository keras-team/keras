    Parameters
    ----------
    n_splits : int, default=5
        Number of folds. Must be at least 2.

            ``n_splits`` default value changed from 3 to 5.

        Note that the samples within each split will not be shuffled.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        When `shuffle` is True, `random_state` affects the ordering of the

    Notes
    -----
    The implementation is designed to:

    * Generate test sets such that all contain the same distribution of
      classes, or as close as possible.
    * Be invariant to class label: relabelling ``y = ["Happy", "Sad"]`` to
      ``y = [1, 0]`` should not change the indices generated.
    * Preserve order dependencies in the dataset ordering, when
      ``shuffle=False``: all samples from class k in some test set were
      contiguous in y, or separated in y by samples from classes other than k.
    * Generate test sets where the smallest and largest differ by at most one
      sample.

    -----

    * Mimic the behavior of StratifiedKFold as much as possible for trivial
      groups (e.g. when each group contains only one sample).
    * Be invariant to class label: relabelling ``y = ["Happy", "Sad"]`` to
      ``y = [1, 0]`` should not change the indices generated.
    * Stratify based on samples as much as possible while keeping
      non-overlapping groups constraint. That means that in some cases when
      there is a small number of groups containing a large number of samples
      the stratification will not be possible and the behavior will be close
      to GroupKFold.

class TimeSeriesSplit(_BaseKFold):
    """Time Series cross-validator.

    Provides train/test indices to split time series data samples
    that are observed at fixed time intervals, in train/test sets.
    In each split, test indices must be higher than before, and thus shuffling
    in cross validator is inappropriate.

    This cross-validation object is a variation of :class:`KFold`.
    In the kth split, it returns first k folds as train set and the
    (k+1)th fold as test set.

    Note that unlike standard cross-validation methods, successive
    training sets are supersets of those that come before them.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <time_series_split>`.

    For visualisation of cross-validation behaviour and
    comparison between common scikit-learn split methods
    refer to :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_plot_cv_indices.py`

    .. versionadded:: 0.18

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_splits : int, default=5
        Number of splits. Must be at least 2.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.22
            ``n_splits`` default value changed from 3 to 5.

    max_train_size : int, default=None
        Maximum size for a single training set.

    test_size : int, default=None
        Used to limit the size of the test set. Defaults to
        ``n_samples // (n_splits + 1)``, which is the maximum allowed value
        with ``gap=0``.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    gap : int, default=0
        Number of samples to exclude from the end of each train set before

class GroupShuffleSplit(GroupsConsumerMixin, BaseShuffleSplit):
    """Shuffle-Group(s)-Out cross-validation iterator.

    Provides randomized train/test indices to split data according to a
    third-party provided group. This group information can be used to encode
    arbitrary domain specific stratifications of the samples as integers.

    For instance the groups could be the year of collection of the samples
    and thus allow for cross-validation against time-based splits.

    The difference between :class:`LeavePGroupsOut` and ``GroupShuffleSplit`` is that
    the former generates splits using all subsets of size ``p`` unique groups,
    whereas ``GroupShuffleSplit`` generates a user-determined number of random
    test splits, each with a user-determined fraction of unique groups.

    For example, a less computationally intensive alternative to
    ``LeavePGroupsOut(p=10)`` would be
    ``GroupShuffleSplit(test_size=10, n_splits=100)``.

    Contrary to other cross-validation strategies, the random splits
    do not guarantee that test sets across all folds will be mutually exclusive,
    and might include overlapping samples. However, this is still very likely for
    sizeable datasets.

    Note: The parameters ``test_size`` and ``train_size`` refer to groups, and

class StratifiedShuffleSplit(BaseShuffleSplit):
    """Stratified ShuffleSplit cross-validator.

    Provides train/test indices to split data in train/test sets.

    This cross-validation object is a merge of :class:`StratifiedKFold` and
    :class:`ShuffleSplit`, which returns stratified randomized folds. The folds
    are made by preserving the percentage of samples for each class.

    Note: like the :class:`ShuffleSplit` strategy, stratified random splits
    do not guarantee that test sets across all folds will be mutually exclusive,
    and might include overlapping samples. However, this is still very likely for
    sizeable datasets.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <stratified_shuffle_split>`.

    For visualisation of cross-validation behaviour and
    comparison between common scikit-learn split methods
    refer to :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_plot_cv_indices.py`

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_splits : int, default=10
        Number of re-shuffling & splitting iterations.

    test_size : float or int, default=None
        If float, should be between 0.0 and 1.0 and represent the proportion
        of the dataset to include in the test split. If int, represents the
        absolute number of test samples. If None, the value is set to the
        complement of the train size. If ``train_size`` is also None, it will
        be set to 0.1.

    train_size : float or int, default=None
        If float, should be between 0.0 and 1.0 and represent the
        proportion of the dataset to include in the train split. If
        int, represents the absolute number of train samples. If None,
        the value is automatically set to the complement of the test size.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Controls the randomness of the training and testing indices produced.
        Pass an int for reproducible output across multiple function calls.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cv : int, cross-validation generator, iterable or None, default=5
        Determines the cross-validation splitting strategy.
        Possible inputs for cv are:
        - None, to use the default 5-fold cross validation,
        - integer, to specify the number of folds.
        - :term:`CV splitter`,
        - An iterable that generates (train, test) splits as arrays of indices.

        For integer/None inputs, if classifier is True and ``y`` is either
        binary or multiclass, :class:`StratifiedKFold` is used. In all other
        cases, :class:`KFold` is used.

        Refer :ref:`User Guide <cross_validation>` for the various
        cross-validation strategies that can be used here.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.22
            ``cv`` default value changed from 3-fold to 5-fold.

    y : array-like, default=None
        The target variable for supervised learning problems.

    classifier : bool, default=False
        Whether the task is a classification task, in which case
        stratified KFold will be used.

    Returns
    -------
    checked_cv : a cross-validator instance.
        The return value is a cross-validator which generates the train/test
        splits via the ``split`` method.

    Examples
    --------

    Quick utility that wraps input validation,

    into a single call for splitting (and optionally subsampling) data into a
    one-liner.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <cross_validation>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    *arrays : sequence of indexables with same length / shape[0]
        Allowed inputs are lists, numpy arrays, scipy-sparse
        matrices or pandas dataframes.

    test_size : float or int, default=None
        If float, should be between 0.0 and 1.0 and represent the proportion
        of the dataset to include in the test split. If int, represents the
        absolute number of test samples. If None, the value is set to the
        complement of the train size. If ``train_size`` is also None, it will
        be set to 0.25.

    train_size : float or int, default=None
        If float, should be between 0.0 and 1.0 and represent the
        proportion of the dataset to include in the train split. If
        int, represents the absolute number of train samples. If None,
        the value is automatically set to the complement of the test size.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Controls the shuffling applied to the data before applying the split.
        Pass an int for reproducible output across multiple function calls.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.

    shuffle : bool, default=True
        Whether or not to shuffle the data before splitting. If shuffle=False
        then stratify must be None.

    stratify : array-like, default=None
        If not None, data is split in a stratified fashion, using this as
        the class labels.
        Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <stratification>`.

    Returns
    -------
    splitting : list, length=2 * len(arrays)
        List containing train-test split of inputs.

        .. versionadded:: 0.16
            If the input is sparse, the output will be a
            ``scipy.sparse.csr_matrix``. Else, output type is the same as the
            input type.

    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
