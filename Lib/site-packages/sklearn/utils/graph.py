    Parameters
    ----------
    graph : {array-like, sparse matrix} of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes)
        Adjacency matrix of the graph. Sparse matrix of format LIL is
        preferred.

    source : int
       Start node for path.

    cutoff : int, default=None
        Depth to stop the search - only paths of length <= cutoff are returned.

    Returns
    -------
    paths : dict
        Reachable end nodes mapped to length of path from source,

    For each pair of unconnected components, compute all pairwise distances

    of samples. This is a hacky way to get a graph with a single connected
    component, which is necessary for example to compute a shortest path
    between all pairs of samples in the graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : array of shape (n_samples, n_features) or (n_samples, n_samples)
        Features to compute the pairwise distances. If `metric =
        "precomputed"`, X is the matrix of pairwise distances.

    graph : sparse matrix of shape (n_samples, n_samples)
        Graph of connection between samples.

    n_connected_components : int
        Number of connected components, as computed by
        `scipy.sparse.csgraph.connected_components`.

    component_labels : array of shape (n_samples)
        Labels of connected components, as computed by
        `scipy.sparse.csgraph.connected_components`.

    mode : {'connectivity', 'distance'}, default='distance'
        Type of graph matrix: 'connectivity' corresponds to the connectivity
        matrix with ones and zeros, and 'distance' corresponds to the distances
        between neighbors according to the given metric.

    metric : str
        Metric used in `sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances`.

    kwargs : kwargs
        Keyword arguments passed to
        `sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances`.

    Returns
    -------
    graph : sparse matrix of shape (n_samples, n_samples)
        Graph of connection between samples, with a single connected component.
