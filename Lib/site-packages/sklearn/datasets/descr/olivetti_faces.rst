The Olivetti faces dataset
--------------------------

`This dataset contains a set of face images`_ taken between April 1992 and
April 1994 at AT&T Laboratories Cambridge. The
:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_olivetti_faces` function is the data
fetching / caching function that downloads the data
archive from AT&T.

.. _This dataset contains a set of face images: https://cam-orl.co.uk/facedatabase.html

As described on the original website:

    There are ten different images of each of 40 distinct subjects. For some
    subjects, the images were taken at different times, varying the lighting,
    facial expressions (open / closed eyes, smiling / not smiling) and facial
    details (glasses / no glasses). All the images were taken against a dark
    homogeneous background with the subjects in an upright, frontal position
    (with tolerance for some side movement).

**Data Set Characteristics:**

=================   =====================
Classes                                40
Samples total                         400
Dimensionality                       4096
Features            real, between 0 and 1
=================   =====================

The image is quantized to 256 grey levels and stored as unsigned 8-bit
integers; the loader will convert these to floating point values on the
interval [0, 1], which are easier to work with for many algorithms.

The "target" for this database is an integer from 0 to 39 indicating the
identity of the person pictured; however, with only 10 examples per class, this
relatively small dataset is more interesting from an unsupervised or
semi-supervised perspective.

The original dataset consisted of 92 x 112, while the version available here
consists of 64x64 images.
