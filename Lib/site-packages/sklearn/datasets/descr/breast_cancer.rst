Breast cancer wisconsin (diagnostic) dataset
--------------------------------------------

**Data Set Characteristics:**

:Number of Instances: 569

:Number of Attributes: 30 numeric, predictive attributes and the class

:Attribute Information:
    - radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
    - texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
    - perimeter
    - area
    - smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
    - compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
    - concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
    - concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
    - symmetry
    - fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

    The mean, standard error, and "worst" or largest (mean of the three
    worst/largest values) of these features were computed for each image,
    resulting in 30 features.  For instance, field 0 is Mean Radius, field
    10 is Radius SE, field 20 is Worst Radius.

    - class:
            - WDBC-Malignant
            - WDBC-Benign

Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle
aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.  They describe
characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

Separating plane described above was obtained using
Multisurface Method-Tree (MSM-T) [K. P. Bennett, "Decision Tree
Construction Via Linear Programming." Proceedings of the 4th
Midwest Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science Society,
pp. 97-101, 1992], a classification method which uses linear
programming to construct a decision tree.  Relevant features
were selected using an exhaustive search in the space of 1-4
features and 1-3 separating planes.

The actual linear program used to obtain the separating plane
in the 3-dimensional space is that described in:
[K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: "Robust Linear
Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets",
Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].
