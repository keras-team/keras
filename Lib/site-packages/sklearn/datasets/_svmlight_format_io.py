    """Load datasets in the svmlight / libsvm format into sparse CSR matrix.

    This format is a text-based format, with one sample per line. It does
    not store zero valued features hence is suitable for sparse dataset.

    The first element of each line can be used to store a target variable
    to predict.

    This format is used as the default format for both svmlight and the
    libsvm command line programs.

    Parsing a text based source can be expensive. When repeatedly
    working on the same dataset, it is recommended to wrap this
    loader with joblib.Memory.cache to store a memmapped backup of the
    CSR results of the first call and benefit from the near instantaneous
    loading of memmapped structures for the subsequent calls.

    In case the file contains a pairwise preference constraint (known
    as "qid" in the svmlight format) these are ignored unless the
    query_id parameter is set to True. These pairwise preference
    constraints can be used to constraint the combination of samples
    when using pairwise loss functions (as is the case in some
    learning to rank problems) so that only pairs with the same
    query_id value are considered.

    This implementation is written in Cython and is reasonably fast.
    However, a faster API-compatible loader is also available at:
    https://github.com/mblondel/svmlight-loader

    Parameters
    ----------
    f : str, path-like, file-like or int
        (Path to) a file to load. If a path ends in ".gz" or ".bz2", it will
        be uncompressed on the fly. If an integer is passed, it is assumed to
        be a file descriptor. A file-like or file descriptor will not be closed
        by this function. A file-like object must be opened in binary mode.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.2
           Path-like objects are now accepted.

    n_features : int, default=None
        The number of features to use. If None, it will be inferred. This
        argument is useful to load several files that are subsets of a
        bigger sliced dataset: each subset might not have examples of
        every feature, hence the inferred shape might vary from one
        slice to another.
        n_features is only required if ``offset`` or ``length`` are passed a
        non-default value.

    dtype : numpy data type, default=np.float64
        Data type of dataset to be loaded. This will be the data type of the
        output numpy arrays ``X`` and ``y``.

    multilabel : bool, default=False
        Samples may have several labels each (see
        https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/multilabel.html).

    zero_based : bool or "auto", default="auto"
        Whether column indices in f are zero-based (True) or one-based
        (False). If column indices are one-based, they are transformed to
        zero-based to match Python/NumPy conventions.
        If set to "auto", a heuristic check is applied to determine this from
        the file contents. Both kinds of files occur "in the wild", but they
        are unfortunately not self-identifying. Using "auto" or True should
        always be safe when no ``offset`` or ``length`` is passed.
        If ``offset`` or ``length`` are passed, the "auto" mode falls back
        to ``zero_based=True`` to avoid having the heuristic check yield
        inconsistent results on different segments of the file.

    query_id : bool, default=False
        If True, will return the query_id array for each file.

    offset : int, default=0
        Ignore the offset first bytes by seeking forward, then
        discarding the following bytes up until the next new line
        character.

    length : int, default=-1
        If strictly positive, stop reading any new line of data once the
        position in the file has reached the (offset + length) bytes threshold.

    Returns
    -------
    X : scipy.sparse matrix of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        The data matrix.

    y : ndarray of shape (n_samples,), or a list of tuples of length n_samples
        The target. It is a list of tuples when ``multilabel=True``, else a
        ndarray.

    query_id : array of shape (n_samples,)
       The query_id for each sample. Only returned when query_id is set to
       True.

    Parameters
    ----------
    files : array-like, dtype=str, path-like, file-like or int
        (Paths of) files to load. If a path ends in ".gz" or ".bz2", it will
        be uncompressed on the fly. If an integer is passed, it is assumed to
        be a file descriptor. File-likes and file descriptors will not be
        closed by this function. File-like objects must be opened in binary
        mode.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.2
           Path-like objects are now accepted.

    n_features : int, default=None
        The number of features to use. If None, it will be inferred from the
        maximum column index occurring in any of the files.

        This can be set to a higher value than the actual number of features
        in any of the input files, but setting it to a lower value will cause
        an exception to be raised.

    dtype : numpy data type, default=np.float64
        Data type of dataset to be loaded. This will be the data type of the
        output numpy arrays ``X`` and ``y``.

    multilabel : bool, default=False
        Samples may have several labels each (see
        https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/multilabel.html).

    zero_based : bool or "auto", default="auto"
        Whether column indices in f are zero-based (True) or one-based
        (False). If column indices are one-based, they are transformed to
        zero-based to match Python/NumPy conventions.
        If set to "auto", a heuristic check is applied to determine this from
        the file contents. Both kinds of files occur "in the wild", but they
        are unfortunately not self-identifying. Using "auto" or True should
        always be safe when no offset or length is passed.
        If offset or length are passed, the "auto" mode falls back
        to zero_based=True to avoid having the heuristic check yield
        inconsistent results on different segments of the file.

    query_id : bool, default=False
        If True, will return the query_id array for each file.

    offset : int, default=0
        Ignore the offset first bytes by seeking forward, then
        discarding the following bytes up until the next new line
        character.

    length : int, default=-1
        If strictly positive, stop reading any new line of data once the
        position in the file has reached the (offset + length) bytes threshold.

    Returns
    -------
    [X1, y1, ..., Xn, yn] or [X1, y1, q1, ..., Xn, yn, qn]: list of arrays
        Each (Xi, yi) pair is the result from load_svmlight_file(files[i]).
        If query_id is set to True, this will return instead (Xi, yi, qi)
        triplets.

    See Also
    --------
    load_svmlight_file: Similar function for loading a single file in this
        format.

    Notes
    -----
    When fitting a model to a matrix X_train and evaluating it against a
    matrix X_test, it is essential that X_train and X_test have the same
    number of features (X_train.shape[1] == X_test.shape[1]). This may not
    be the case if you load the files individually with load_svmlight_file.
