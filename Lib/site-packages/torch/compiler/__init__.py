    Tells the compiler frontend (Dynamo) to skip symbolic introspection of the function
    and instead directly write it to the graph when encountered.

    If you are using :func:`torch.compile` (with backend="inductor" (the default)), or
    :func:`torch.export.export`, and trying to black-box a Python function throughout
    all tracing, do not use this API.
    Instead, please create a custom operator (see `PyTorch Custom Operators Landing Page
    <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/custom_ops_landing_page.html>`_)

    .. warning::

        If you're a typical torch.compile user (e.g. you're applying torch.compile to
        a model to make it run faster), you probably don't want to use this function.
        :func:`allow_in_graph` is a footgun because it skips the compiler frontend
        (Dynamo) that is responsible for doing safety checks (graph breaks, handling
        closures, etc). Incorrect usage will lead to difficult-to-debug silent
        incorrectness issues.

    Given a Python function with no allow_in_graph decorator, regular execution
    of torch.compile traces through the function. :func:`allow_in_graph` changes
    it so that the frontend does not trace inside the function, but the compiler
    backend still traces through it. Compare this to custom operators, which
    treats a function as a black box throughout the torch.compile stack. The following
    table compares these mechanisms.

    +------------------------+-----------------------+--------------------------------+
    | Mechanism              | Frontend (Dynamo)     | Backend (AOTAutograd+Inductor) |
    +========================+=======================+================================+
    | no decorator           | trace inside          | trace inside                   |
    +------------------------+-----------------------+--------------------------------+
    | allow_in_graph         | opaque callable       | trace inside                   |

    +------------------------+-----------------------+--------------------------------+

    One common use case for :func:`allow_in_graph()` is as an escape hatch for the compiler
    frontend: if you know the function works w.r.t. to the downstream components of the
    compilation stack (AOTAutograd and Inductor) but there is a Dynamo bug that prevents it from
    symbolically introspecting the function properly (or if your code is in C/C++ and
    therefore cannot be introspected with Dynamo), then one can decorate said function
    with :func:`allow_in_graph` to bypass Dynamo.

    We require that ``fn`` adhere to the following restrictions. Failure to adhere
    results in undefined behavior:

    - The inputs to ``fn`` must be Proxy-able types in the FX graph. Valid types include:
      Tensor/int/bool/float/None/List[Tensor?]/List[int?]/List[float?]
      Tuple[Tensor?, ...]/Tuple[int?, ...]/Tuple[float?, ...]/torch.dtype/torch.device
    - The outputs to ``fn`` must be Proxy-able types in the FX graph (see previous bullet)
    - all Tensors used inside of ``fn`` must be passed directly as inputs to ``fn``
      (as opposed to being captured variables).

    Args:
        fn: A callable representing the function to be included in the graph.
            If ``fn`` is a list or tuple of callables it recursively applies
            :func:`allow_in_graph()` to each function and returns a new list or
            tuple containing the modified functions.

    Example::

        torch.compiler.allow_in_graph(my_custom_function)

        @torch.compile(...)
        def fn(x):
            x = torch.add(x, 1)
            x = my_custom_function(x)
            x = torch.add(x, 1)
            return x

        fn(...)

    Will capture a single graph containing ``my_custom_function()``.

        The polyfill handler is only used when inlining the original function. It is not used when

        the performant C function rather than the polyfill handler.

    The polyfill handler is a function that will be called in place of the original function when
    inlining the original function. The polyfill handler should have the same signature and the same

            meets the following conditions.

            torch.compile uses a guard system to support recompilations and
            choose which compiled artifact to run at runtime.  These guards,
            though efficient, add some overhead, which may impact performance in
            scenarios where you need to optimize for minimal guard processing
            time.  This API enables you to disable guard evaluation, assuming
            that you have warmed up the compiled model with a sufficient variety
            of inputs. This assumption means that, after the warmup phase, no
            further recompilations will be necessary.  If this assumption fails,
            there is a risk of silently producing incorrect results (hence the
            term "unsafe" in the API name).
