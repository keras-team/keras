  """Builds a training loop for TPUs.

  The set of loop-carried tensors corresponds to `inputs`.  Both
  `condition` and `body` take the current value of the loop-carried
  tensors. 'body' additionally takes a tuple of infeed from
  infeed_queue if infeed_queue is not None. `condition` must return a
  single boolean value that determines whether iteration
  continues. `body` must return an updated list of values for the
  loop-carried tensors.

  Args:
    condition: a Python function that builds the loop condition.
    body: a Python function that builds the loop body.
    inputs: a list of initial values passed into the training loop, or None
      (equivalent to an empty list).
    infeed_queue: if not None, the infeed queue from which to append a tuple of
      arguments as inputs to condition.
    name: (Deprecated) Does nothing.

  Returns:
    The final values of the loop-carried tensors.

  Raises:
    TypeError: if body or condition has the wrong signature.
