  """Applies exponential decay to the learning rate.

  When training a model, it is often recommended to lower the learning rate as
  the training progresses.  This function applies an exponential decay function
  to a provided initial learning rate.  It requires a `global_step` value to
  compute the decayed learning rate.  You can just pass a TensorFlow variable
  that you increment at each training step.

  The function returns the decayed learning rate.  It is computed as:

  ```python
  decayed_learning_rate = learning_rate *
                          decay_rate ^ (global_step / decay_steps)
  ```

  If the argument `staircase` is `True`, then `global_step / decay_steps` is an
  integer division and the decayed learning rate follows a staircase function.

  Example: decay every 100000 steps with a base of 0.96:

  ```python
  ...
  global_step = tf.Variable(0, trainable=False)
  starter_learning_rate = 0.1
  learning_rate = tf.compat.v1.train.exponential_decay(starter_learning_rate,
  global_step,
                                             100000, 0.96, staircase=True)
  # Passing global_step to minimize() will increment it at each step.
  learning_step = (
      tf.compat.v1.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(learning_rate)
      .minimize(...my loss..., global_step=global_step)
  )
  ```

  Args:
    learning_rate: A scalar `float32` or `float64` `Tensor` or a Python number.
      The initial learning rate.
    global_step: A scalar `int32` or `int64` `Tensor` or a Python number. Global
      step to use for the decay computation.  Must not be negative.
    decay_steps: A scalar `int32` or `int64` `Tensor` or a Python number. Must
      be positive.  See the decay computation above.
    decay_rate: A scalar `float32` or `float64` `Tensor` or a Python number.
      The decay rate.
    staircase: Boolean.  If `True` decay the learning rate at discrete intervals
    name: String.  Optional name of the operation.  Defaults to
      'ExponentialDecay'.

  Returns:
    A scalar `Tensor` of the same type as `learning_rate`.  The decayed

  This function applies a polynomial decay function to a provided initial

  It requires a `global_step` value to compute the decayed learning rate.  You

  If `cycle` is True then a multiple of `decay_steps` is used, the first one

  """Applies linear cosine decay to the learning rate.

  Note that linear cosine decay is more aggressive than cosine decay and
  larger initial learning rates can typically be used.

  When training a model, it is often recommended to lower the learning rate as
  the training progresses.  This function applies a linear cosine decay function
  to a provided initial learning rate.  It requires a `global_step` value to
  compute the decayed learning rate.  You can just pass a TensorFlow variable
  that you increment at each training step.

  The function returns the decayed learning rate.  It is computed as:
  ```python
  global_step = min(global_step, decay_steps)
  linear_decay = (decay_steps - global_step) / decay_steps)
  cosine_decay = 0.5 * (
      1 + cos(pi * 2 * num_periods * global_step / decay_steps))
  decayed = (alpha + linear_decay) * cosine_decay + beta
  decayed_learning_rate = learning_rate * decayed
  ```

  Example usage:
  ```python
  decay_steps = 1000
  lr_decayed = linear_cosine_decay(learning_rate, global_step, decay_steps)
  ```

  Args:
    learning_rate: A scalar `float32` or `float64` Tensor or a Python number.
      The initial learning rate.
    global_step: A scalar `int32` or `int64` `Tensor` or a Python number. Global
      step to use for the decay computation.
    decay_steps: A scalar `int32` or `int64` `Tensor` or a Python number. Number
      of steps to decay over.
    num_periods: Number of periods in the cosine part of the decay. See
      computation above.
    alpha: See computation above.
    beta: See computation above.
    name: String.  Optional name of the operation.  Defaults to
      'LinearCosineDecay'.

  Returns:
    A scalar `Tensor` of the same type as `learning_rate`.  The decayed
    learning rate.
  Raises:
    ValueError: if `global_step` is not supplied.
