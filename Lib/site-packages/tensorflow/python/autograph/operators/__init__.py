"""This module implements operators that AutoGraph overloads.

Note that "operator" is used loosely here, and includes control structures like
conditionals and loops, implemented in functional form, using for example
closures for the body.
"""

# Naming conventions:
#  * operator names match the name usually used for the respective Python
#    idiom; examples: for_stmt, list_append
#  * operator arguments match either of:
#    - the corresponding Python AST attribute (e.g. the condition of an if
#      statement is called test) if the operator represents an AST construct
#    - the names used in the Python docs, if the operator is a function (e.g.
#      list_ and x for append, see
#      https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/datastructures.html)
#
# All operators may accept a final argument named "opts", of a type that
# subclasses namedtuple and contains any arguments that are only required
# for some specializations of the operator.
