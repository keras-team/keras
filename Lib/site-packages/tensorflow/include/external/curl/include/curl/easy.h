 *
 * Request internal information from the curl session with this function.

 * which is documented in each manpage of the option. The data pointed to
 * will be filled in accordingly and can be relied upon only if the function
 * returns CURLE_OK. This function is intended to get used *AFTER* a performed

 * passed in. Duplicating a handle could only be a matter of cloning data and
 * options, internal state info and things like persistent connections cannot
 * be transferred. It is useful in multithreaded applications when you can run
 * curl_easy_duphandle() for each new thread to avoid a series of identical
 * curl_easy_setopt() invokes in every thread.

 * It does keep: live connections, the Session ID cache, the DNS cache and the
 * cookies.
