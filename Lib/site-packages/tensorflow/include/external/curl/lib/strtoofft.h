/*
 * Determine which string to integral data type conversion function we use
 * to implement string conversion to our curl_off_t integral data type.
 *
 * Notice that curl_off_t might be 64 or 32 bits wide, and that it might use
 * an underlying data type which might be 'long', 'int64_t', 'long long' or
 * '__int64' and more remotely other data types.
 *
 * On systems where the size of curl_off_t is greater than the size of 'long'
 * the conversion function to use is strtoll() if it is available, otherwise,
 * we emulate its functionality with our own clone.
 *
 * On systems where the size of curl_off_t is smaller or equal than the size
 * of 'long' the conversion function to use is strtol().
