     A litmus test that may help a service implementor in deciding
     between FAILED_PRECONDITION, ABORTED, and UNAVAILABLE:
      (a) Use UNAVAILABLE if the client can retry just the failing call.
      (b) Use ABORTED if the client should retry at a higher-level
          (e.g., restarting a read-modify-write sequence).
      (c) Use FAILED_PRECONDITION if the client should not retry until
          the system state has been explicitly fixed.  E.g., if an "rmdir"
          fails because the directory is non-empty, FAILED_PRECONDITION
          should be returned since the client should not retry unless
          they have first fixed up the directory by deleting files from it.
      (d) Use FAILED_PRECONDITION if the client performs conditional
          REST Get/Update/Delete on a resource and the resource on the
          server does not match the condition. E.g., conflicting
          read-modify-write on the same resource. */

  /** Operation was attempted past the valid range.  E.g., seeking or
     reading past end of file.

     Unlike INVALID_ARGUMENT, this error indicates a problem that may
     be fixed if the system state changes. For example, a 32-bit file
     system will generate INVALID_ARGUMENT if asked to read at an
     offset that is not in the range [0,2^32-1], but it will generate
     OUT_OF_RANGE if asked to read from an offset past the current
     file size.

     There is a fair bit of overlap between FAILED_PRECONDITION and
     OUT_OF_RANGE.  We recommend using OUT_OF_RANGE (the more specific
     error) when it applies so that callers who are iterating through
     a space can easily look for an OUT_OF_RANGE error to detect when
     they are done. */

     WARNING: Although data MIGHT not have been transmitted when this
     status occurs, there is NOT A GUARANTEE that the server has not seen
     anything. So in general it is unsafe to retry on this status code
     if the call is non-idempotent.
