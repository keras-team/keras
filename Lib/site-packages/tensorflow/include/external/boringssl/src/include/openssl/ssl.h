// Cipher suite configuration.
//
// OpenSSL uses a mini-language to configure cipher suites. The language
// maintains an ordered list of enabled ciphers, along with an ordered list of
// disabled but available ciphers. Initially, all ciphers are disabled with a
// default ordering. The cipher string is then interpreted as a sequence of
// directives, separated by colons, each of which modifies this state.
//
// Most directives consist of a one character or empty opcode followed by a
// selector which matches a subset of available ciphers.
//
// Available opcodes are:
//
//   The empty opcode enables and appends all matching disabled ciphers to the
//   end of the enabled list. The newly appended ciphers are ordered relative to
//   each other matching their order in the disabled list.
//
//   |-| disables all matching enabled ciphers and prepends them to the disabled
//   list, with relative order from the enabled list preserved. This means the
//   most recently disabled ciphers get highest preference relative to other
//   disabled ciphers if re-enabled.
//
//   |+| moves all matching enabled ciphers to the end of the enabled list, with
//   relative order preserved.
//
//   |!| deletes all matching ciphers, enabled or not, from either list. Deleted
//   ciphers will not matched by future operations.
//
// A selector may be a specific cipher (using either the standard or OpenSSL
// name for the cipher) or one or more rules separated by |+|. The final
// selector matches the intersection of each rule. For instance, |AESGCM+aECDSA|
// matches ECDSA-authenticated AES-GCM ciphers.
//
// Available cipher rules are:
//
//   |ALL| matches all ciphers.
//
//   |kRSA|, |kDHE|, |kECDHE|, and |kPSK| match ciphers using plain RSA, DHE,
//   ECDHE, and plain PSK key exchanges, respectively. Note that ECDHE_PSK is
//   matched by |kECDHE| and not |kPSK|.
//
//   |aRSA|, |aECDSA|, and |aPSK| match ciphers authenticated by RSA, ECDSA, and
//   a pre-shared key, respectively.
//
//   |RSA|, |DHE|, |ECDHE|, |PSK|, |ECDSA|, and |PSK| are aliases for the
//   corresponding |k*| or |a*| cipher rule. |RSA| is an alias for |kRSA|, not
//   |aRSA|.
//
//   |3DES|, |AES128|, |AES256|, |AES|, |AESGCM|, |CHACHA20| match ciphers
//   whose bulk cipher use the corresponding encryption scheme. Note that
//   |AES|, |AES128|, and |AES256| match both CBC and GCM ciphers.
//
//   |SHA1|, and its alias |SHA|, match legacy cipher suites using HMAC-SHA1.
//
// Although implemented, authentication-only ciphers match no rules and must be
// explicitly selected by name.
//
// Deprecated cipher rules:
//
//   |kEDH|, |EDH|, |kEECDH|, and |EECDH| are legacy aliases for |kDHE|, |DHE|,
//   |kECDHE|, and |ECDHE|, respectively.
//
//   |HIGH| is an alias for |ALL|.
//
//   |FIPS| is an alias for |HIGH|.
//
//   |SSLv3| and |TLSv1| match ciphers available in TLS 1.1 or earlier.
//   |TLSv1_2| matches ciphers new in TLS 1.2. This is confusing and should not
//   be used.
//
// Unknown rules are silently ignored by legacy APIs, and rejected by APIs with
// "strict" in the name, which should be preferred. Cipher lists can be long
// and it's easy to commit typos. Strict functions will also reject the use of
// spaces, semi-colons and commas as alternative separators.
//
// The special |@STRENGTH| directive will sort all enabled ciphers by strength.
//
// The |DEFAULT| directive, when appearing at the front of the string, expands
// to the default ordering of available ciphers.
//
// If configuring a server, one may also configure equal-preference groups to
// partially respect the client's preferences when
// |SSL_OP_CIPHER_SERVER_PREFERENCE| is enabled. Ciphers in an equal-preference
// group have equal priority and use the client order. This may be used to
// enforce that AEADs are preferred but select AES-GCM vs. ChaCha20-Poly1305
// based on client preferences. An equal-preference is specified with square
// brackets, combining multiple selectors separated by |. For example:
//
//   [TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256|TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256]
//
// Once an equal-preference group is used, future directives must be
// opcode-less. Inside an equal-preference group, spaces are not allowed.
//
// TLS 1.3 ciphers do not participate in this mechanism and instead have a
// built-in preference order. Functions to set cipher lists do not affect TLS
// 1.3, and functions to query the cipher list do not include TLS 1.3
// ciphers.

// Session caching.
//
// Session caching allows connections to be established more efficiently based
// on saved parameters from a previous connection, called a session (see
// |SSL_SESSION|). The client offers a saved session, using an opaque identifier
// from a previous connection. The server may accept the session, if it has the
// parameters available. Otherwise, it will decline and continue with a full
// handshake.
//
// This requires both the client and the server to retain session state. A
// client does so with a stateful session cache. A server may do the same or, if
// supported by both sides, statelessly using session tickets. For more
// information on the latter, see the next section.
//
// For a server, the library implements a built-in internal session cache as an
// in-memory hash table. Servers may also use |SSL_CTX_sess_set_get_cb| and
// |SSL_CTX_sess_set_new_cb| to implement a custom external session cache. In
// particular, this may be used to share a session cache between multiple
// servers in a large deployment. An external cache may be used in addition to
// or instead of the internal one. Use |SSL_CTX_set_session_cache_mode| to
// toggle the internal cache.
//
// For a client, the only option is an external session cache. Clients may use
// |SSL_CTX_sess_set_new_cb| to register a callback for when new sessions are
// available. These may be cached and, in subsequent compatible connections,
// configured with |SSL_set_session|.
//
// Note that offering or accepting a session short-circuits certificate
// verification and most parameter negotiation. Resuming sessions across
// different contexts may result in security failures and surprising
// behavior. For a typical client, this means sessions for different hosts must
// be cached under different keys. A client that connects to the same host with,
// e.g., different cipher suite settings or client certificates should also use
// separate session caches between those contexts. Servers should also partition
// session caches between SNI hosts with |SSL_CTX_set_session_id_context|.
//
// Note also, in TLS 1.2 and earlier, offering sessions allows passive observers
// to correlate different client connections. TLS 1.3 and later fix this,
// provided clients use sessions at most once. Session caches are managed by the
// caller in BoringSSL, so this must be implemented externally. See

// Session tickets.
//
// Session tickets, from RFC 5077, allow session resumption without server-side
// state. The server maintains a secret ticket key and sends the client opaque
// encrypted session parameters, called a ticket. When offering the session, the
// client sends the ticket which the server decrypts to recover session state.
// Session tickets are enabled by default but may be disabled with
// |SSL_OP_NO_TICKET|.
//
// On the client, ticket-based sessions use the same APIs as ID-based tickets.
// Callers do not need to handle them differently.
//
// On the server, tickets are encrypted and authenticated with a secret key.
// By default, an |SSL_CTX| will manage session ticket encryption keys by
// generating them internally and rotating every 48 hours. Tickets are minted
// and processed transparently. The following functions may be used to configure
// a persistent key or implement more custom behavior, including key rotation
// and sharing keys between multiple servers in a large deployment. There are
// three levels of customisation possible:
//
// 1) One can simply set the keys with |SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_ticket_keys|.
// 2) One can configure an |EVP_CIPHER_CTX| and |HMAC_CTX| directly for
//    encryption and authentication.
// 3) One can configure an |SSL_TICKET_AEAD_METHOD| to have more control
//    and the option of asynchronous decryption.
//
// An attacker that compromises a server's session ticket key can impersonate
// the server and, prior to TLS 1.3, retroactively decrypt all application
// traffic from sessions using that ticket key. Thus ticket keys must be
// regularly rotated for forward secrecy. Note the default key is rotated
// automatically once every 48 hours but manually configured keys are not.

// credentials can't be revoked. In order to mitigate the damage in case the
// credential secret key is compromised, the credential is only valid for a
// short time (days, hours, or even minutes). This library implements draft-03
// of the protocol spec.
//
// The extension ID has not been assigned; we're using 0xff02 for the time

// QUIC integration.
//
// QUIC acts as an underlying transport for the TLS 1.3 handshake. The following
// functions allow a QUIC implementation to serve as the underlying transport as
// described in RFC 9001.
//
// When configured for QUIC, |SSL_do_handshake| will drive the handshake as
// before, but it will not use the configured |BIO|. It will call functions on
// |SSL_QUIC_METHOD| to configure secrets and send data. If data is needed from
// the peer, it will return |SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ|. As the caller receives data
// it can decrypt, it calls |SSL_provide_quic_data|. Subsequent
// |SSL_do_handshake| calls will then consume that data and progress the
// handshake. After the handshake is complete, the caller should continue to
// call |SSL_provide_quic_data| for any post-handshake data, followed by
// |SSL_process_quic_post_handshake| to process it. It is an error to call
// |SSL_read| and |SSL_write| in QUIC.
//
// 0-RTT behaves similarly to |TLS_method|'s usual behavior. |SSL_do_handshake|
// returns early as soon as the client (respectively, server) is allowed to send
// 0-RTT (respectively, half-RTT) data. The caller should then call
// |SSL_do_handshake| again to consume the remaining handshake messages and
// confirm the handshake. As a client, |SSL_ERROR_EARLY_DATA_REJECTED| and
// |SSL_reset_early_data_reject| behave as usual.
//
// See https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9001.html#section-4.1 for more details.
//
// To avoid DoS attacks, the QUIC implementation must limit the amount of data
// being queued up. The implementation can call
// |SSL_quic_max_handshake_flight_len| to get the maximum buffer length at each
// encryption level.
//
// QUIC implementations must additionally configure transport parameters with
// |SSL_set_quic_transport_params|. |SSL_get_peer_quic_transport_params| may be
// used to query the value received from the peer. BoringSSL handles this
// extension as an opaque byte string. The caller is responsible for serializing
// and parsing them. See https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000#section-7.4 for
// details.
//
// QUIC additionally imposes restrictions on 0-RTT. In particular, the QUIC
// transport layer requires that if a server accepts 0-RTT data, then the
// transport parameters sent on the resumed connection must not lower any limits
// compared to the transport parameters that the server sent on the connection
// where the ticket for 0-RTT was issued. In effect, the server must remember
// the transport parameters with the ticket. Application protocols running on
// QUIC may impose similar restrictions, for example HTTP/3's restrictions on
// SETTINGS frames.
//
// BoringSSL implements this check by doing a byte-for-byte comparison of an
// opaque context passed in by the server. This context must be the same on the
// connection where the ticket was issued and the connection where that ticket
// is used for 0-RTT. If there is a mismatch, or the context was not set,
// BoringSSL will reject early data (but not reject the resumption attempt).
// This context is set via |SSL_set_quic_early_data_context| and should cover
// both transport parameters and any application state.
// |SSL_set_quic_early_data_context| must be called on the server with a
// non-empty context if the server is to support 0-RTT in QUIC.
//
// BoringSSL does not perform any client-side checks on the transport
// parameters received from a server that also accepted early data. It is up to
// the caller to verify that the received transport parameters do not lower any
// limits, and to close the QUIC connection if that is not the case. The same
// holds for any application protocol state remembered for 0-RTT, e.g. HTTP/3

// Early data.
//
// WARNING: 0-RTT support in BoringSSL is currently experimental and not fully
// implemented. It may cause interoperability or security failures when used.
//
// Early data, or 0-RTT, is a feature in TLS 1.3 which allows clients to send
// data on the first flight during a resumption handshake. This can save a
// round-trip in some application protocols.
//
// WARNING: A 0-RTT handshake has different security properties from normal
// handshake, so it is off by default unless opted in. In particular, early data
// is replayable by a network attacker. Callers must account for this when
// sending or processing data before the handshake is confirmed. See RFC 8446
// for more information.
//
// As a server, if early data is accepted, |SSL_do_handshake| will complete as
// soon as the ClientHello is processed and server flight sent. |SSL_write| may
// be used to send half-RTT data. |SSL_read| will consume early data and
// transition to 1-RTT data as appropriate. Prior to the transition,
// |SSL_in_init| will report the handshake is still in progress. Callers may use
// it or |SSL_in_early_data| to defer or reject requests as needed.
//
// Early data as a client is more complex. If the offered session (see
// |SSL_set_session|) is 0-RTT-capable, the handshake will return after sending
// the ClientHello. The predicted peer certificates and ALPN protocol will be
// available via the usual APIs. |SSL_write| will write early data, up to the
// session's limit. Writes past this limit and |SSL_read| will complete the
// handshake before continuing. Callers may also call |SSL_do_handshake| again
// to complete the handshake sooner.
//
// If the server accepts early data, the handshake will succeed. |SSL_read| and
// |SSL_write| will then act as in a 1-RTT handshake. The peer certificates and
// ALPN protocol will be as predicted and need not be re-queried.
//
// If the server rejects early data, |SSL_do_handshake| (and thus |SSL_read| and
// |SSL_write|) will then fail with |SSL_get_error| returning
// |SSL_ERROR_EARLY_DATA_REJECTED|. The caller should treat this as a connection
// error and most likely perform a high-level retry. Note the server may still
// have processed the early data due to attacker replays.
//
// To then continue the handshake on the original connection, use
// |SSL_reset_early_data_reject|. The connection will then behave as one which
// had not yet completed the handshake. This allows a faster retry than making a
// fresh connection. |SSL_do_handshake| will complete the full handshake,
// possibly resulting in different peer certificates, ALPN protocol, and other
// properties. The caller must disregard any values from before the reset and
// query again.

// on a fresh connection without 0-RTT if the handshake fails with
// |SSL_R_WRONG_VERSION_ON_EARLY_DATA|.

// Handshake hints.
//
// *** EXPERIMENTAL — DO NOT USE WITHOUT CHECKING ***
//
// Some server deployments make asynchronous RPC calls in both ClientHello
// dispatch and private key operations. In TLS handshakes where the private key
// operation occurs in the first round-trip, this results in two consecutive RPC
// round-trips. Handshake hints allow the RPC service to predicte a signature.
// If correctly predicted, this can skip the second RPC call.
//
// First, the server installs a certificate selection callback (see
// |SSL_CTX_set_select_certificate_cb|). When that is called, it performs the
// RPC as before, but includes the ClientHello and a capabilities string from
// |SSL_serialize_capabilities|.
//
// Next, the RPC service creates its own |SSL| object, applies the results of
// certificate selection, calls |SSL_request_handshake_hints|, and runs the
// handshake. If this successfully computes handshake hints (see
// |SSL_serialize_handshake_hints|), the RPC server should send the hints
// alongside any certificate selection results.
//
// Finally, the server calls |SSL_set_handshake_hints| and applies any
// configuration from the RPC server. It then completes the handshake as before.
// If the hints apply, BoringSSL will use the predicted signature and skip the
// private key callbacks. Otherwise, BoringSSL will call private key callbacks
// to generate a signature as before.
//
// Callers should synchronize configuration across the two services.
// Configuration mismatches and some cases of version skew are not fatal, but
// may result in the hints not applying. Additionally, some handshake flows use
// the private key in later round-trips, such as TLS 1.3 HelloRetryRequest. In
// those cases, BoringSSL will not predict a signature as there is no benefit.
// Callers must allow for handshakes to complete without a predicted signature.
//
// Handshake hints are supported for TLS 1.3 and partially supported for
// TLS 1.2. TLS 1.2 resumption handshakes are not yet fully hinted. They will
// still work, but may not be as efficient.

// SSL_serialize_capabilities writes an opaque byte string to |out| describing
// some of |ssl|'s capabilities. It returns one on success and zero on error.
//
// This string is used by BoringSSL internally to reduce the impact of version
// skew.

// should contain a serialized ClientHello structure, from the |client_hello|
// and |client_hello_len| fields of the |SSL_CLIENT_HELLO| structure.
// |capabilities| should contain the output of |SSL_serialize_capabilities|.
//
// When configured, |ssl| will perform no I/O (so there is no need to configure
// |BIO|s). For QUIC, the caller should still configure an |SSL_QUIC_METHOD|,
// but the callbacks themselves will never be called and may be left NULL or
// report failure. |SSL_provide_quic_data| also should not be called.
//
// If hint generation is successful, |SSL_do_handshake| will stop the handshake
// early with |SSL_get_error| returning |SSL_ERROR_HANDSHAKE_HINTS_READY|. At
// this point, the caller should run |SSL_serialize_handshake_hints| to extract
// the resulting hints.

//
// Split handshakes.
//
// Split handshakes allows the handshake part of a TLS connection to be
// performed in a different process (or on a different machine) than the data
// exchange. This only applies to servers.
//
// In the first part of a split handshake, an |SSL| (where the |SSL_CTX| has
// been configured with |SSL_CTX_set_handoff_mode|) is used normally. Once the
// ClientHello message has been received, the handshake will stop and
// |SSL_get_error| will indicate |SSL_ERROR_HANDOFF|. At this point (and only
// at this point), |SSL_serialize_handoff| can be called to write the “handoff”
// state of the connection.
//
// Elsewhere, a fresh |SSL| can be used with |SSL_apply_handoff| to continue
// the connection. The connection from the client is fed into this |SSL|, and
// the handshake resumed. When the handshake stops again and |SSL_get_error|
// indicates |SSL_ERROR_HANDBACK|, |SSL_serialize_handback| should be called to
// serialize the state of the handshake again.
//
// Back at the first location, a fresh |SSL| can be used with
// |SSL_apply_handback|. Then the client's connection can be processed mostly
// as normal.
//
// Lastly, when a connection is in the handoff state, whether or not
// |SSL_serialize_handoff| is called, |SSL_decline_handoff| will move it back
// into a normal state where the connection can proceed without impact.
//
// WARNING: Currently only works with TLS 1.0–1.2.
// WARNING: The serialisation formats are not yet stable: version skew may be
//     fatal.
// WARNING: The handback data contains sensitive key material and must be
//     protected.
// WARNING: Some calls on the final |SSL| will not work. Just as an example,
//     calls like |SSL_get0_session_id_context| and |SSL_get_privatekey| won't
//     work because the certificate used for handshaking isn't available.
// WARNING: |SSL_apply_handoff| may trigger “msg” callback calls.
