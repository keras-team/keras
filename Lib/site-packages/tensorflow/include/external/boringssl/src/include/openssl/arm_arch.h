// We require the ARM assembler provide |__ARM_ARCH| from Arm C Language
// Extensions (ACLE). This is supported in GCC 4.8+ and Clang 3.2+. MSVC does
// not implement ACLE, but we require Clang's assembler on Windows.
#if !defined(__ARM_ARCH)
#error "ARM assembler must define __ARM_ARCH"
#endif

// __ARM_ARCH__ is used by OpenSSL assembly to determine the minimum target ARM
// version.
//
// TODO(davidben): Switch the assembly to use |__ARM_ARCH| directly.
#define __ARM_ARCH__ __ARM_ARCH

// Even when building for 32-bit ARM, support for aarch64 crypto instructions
// will be included.
#define __ARM_MAX_ARCH__ 8

// Support macros for
//   - Armv8.3-A Pointer Authentication and
//   - Armv8.5-A Branch Target Identification
// features which require emitting a .note.gnu.property section with the
// appropriate architecture-dependent feature bits set.
//
// |AARCH64_SIGN_LINK_REGISTER| and |AARCH64_VALIDATE_LINK_REGISTER| expand to
// PACIxSP and AUTIxSP, respectively. |AARCH64_SIGN_LINK_REGISTER| should be
// used immediately before saving the LR register (x30) to the stack.
// |AARCH64_VALIDATE_LINK_REGISTER| should be used immediately after restoring
// it. Note |AARCH64_SIGN_LINK_REGISTER|'s modifications to LR must be undone
// with |AARCH64_VALIDATE_LINK_REGISTER| before RET. The SP register must also
// have the same value at the two points. For example:
//
//   .global f
//   f:
//     AARCH64_SIGN_LINK_REGISTER
//     stp x29, x30, [sp, #-96]!
//     mov x29, sp
//     ...
//     ldp x29, x30, [sp], #96
//     AARCH64_VALIDATE_LINK_REGISTER
//     ret
//
// |AARCH64_VALID_CALL_TARGET| expands to BTI 'c'. Either it, or
// |AARCH64_SIGN_LINK_REGISTER|, must be used at every point that may be an
// indirect call target. In particular, all symbols exported from a file must
// begin with one of these macros. For example, a leaf function that does not
// save LR can instead use |AARCH64_VALID_CALL_TARGET|:
//
//   .globl return_zero
//   return_zero:
//     AARCH64_VALID_CALL_TARGET
//     mov x0, #0
//     ret
//
// A non-leaf function which does not immediately save LR may need both macros
// because |AARCH64_SIGN_LINK_REGISTER| appears late. For example, the function
// may jump to an alternate implementation before setting up the stack:
//
//   .globl with_early_jump
//   with_early_jump:
//     AARCH64_VALID_CALL_TARGET
//     cmp x0, #128
//     b.lt .Lwith_early_jump_128
//     AARCH64_SIGN_LINK_REGISTER
//     stp x29, x30, [sp, #-96]!
//     mov x29, sp
//     ...
//     ldp x29, x30, [sp], #96
//     AARCH64_VALIDATE_LINK_REGISTER
//     ret
//
//  .Lwith_early_jump_128:
//     ...
//     ret
//
// These annotations are only required with indirect calls. Private symbols that
// are only the target of direct calls do not require annotations. Also note
// that |AARCH64_VALID_CALL_TARGET| is only valid for indirect calls (BLR), not
// indirect jumps (BR). Indirect jumps in assembly are currently not supported
// and would require a macro for BTI 'j'.
//
// Although not necessary, it is safe to use these macros in 32-bit ARM
// assembly. This may be used to simplify dual 32-bit and 64-bit files.
