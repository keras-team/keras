// Engines are collections of methods. Methods are tables of function pointers,
// defined for certain algorithms, that allow operations on those algorithms to
// be overridden via a callback. This can be used, for example, to implement an
// RSA* that forwards operations to a hardware module.
//
// Methods are reference counted but |ENGINE|s are not. When creating a method,
// you should zero the whole structure and fill in the function pointers that
// you wish before setting it on an |ENGINE|. Any functions pointers that
// are NULL indicate that the default behaviour should be used.

// size allows for ABI compatibility in the case that the method structure is
// extended with extra elements at the end. Methods are always copied by the
// set functions.
//
// Set functions return one on success and zero on allocation failure.
