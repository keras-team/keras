// base64 functions.
//
// For historical reasons, these functions have the EVP_ prefix but just do
// base64 encoding and decoding. Note that BoringSSL is a cryptography library,
// so these functions are implemented with side channel protections, at a
// performance cost. For other base64 uses, use a general-purpose base64
// implementation.


// Encoding

// EVP_EncodeBlock encodes |src_len| bytes from |src| and writes the
// result to |dst| with a trailing NUL. It returns the number of bytes
// written, not including this trailing NUL.
OPENSSL_EXPORT size_t EVP_EncodeBlock(uint8_t *dst, const uint8_t *src,

// EVP_EncodedLength sets |*out_len| to the number of bytes that will be needed
// to call |EVP_EncodeBlock| on an input of length |len|. This includes the
// final NUL that |EVP_EncodeBlock| writes. It returns one on success or zero
// on error.
OPENSSL_EXPORT int EVP_EncodedLength(size_t *out_len, size_t len);


// Decoding

// EVP_DecodedLength sets |*out_len| to the maximum number of bytes that will
// be needed to call |EVP_DecodeBase64| on an input of length |len|. It returns
// one on success or zero if |len| is not a valid length for a base64-encoded
// string.
OPENSSL_EXPORT int EVP_DecodedLength(size_t *out_len, size_t len);

// EVP_DecodeBase64 decodes |in_len| bytes from base64 and writes
// |*out_len| bytes to |out|. |max_out| is the size of the output
// buffer. If it is not enough for the maximum output size, the
// operation fails. It returns one on success or zero on error.

// OpenSSL provides a streaming base64 implementation, however its behavior is
// very specific to PEM. It is also very lenient of invalid input. Use of any of
// these functions is thus deprecated.
