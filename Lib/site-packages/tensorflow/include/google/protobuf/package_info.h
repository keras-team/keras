//  Based on original Protocol Buffers design by
//  Sanjay Ghemawat, Jeff Dean, and others.
//
// This file exists solely to document the google::protobuf namespace.
// It is not compiled into anything, but it may be read by an automated
// documentation generator.

// Core components of the Protocol Buffers runtime library.
//
// The files in this package represent the core of the Protocol Buffer
// system.  All of them are part of the libprotobuf library.
//
// A note on thread-safety:
//
// Thread-safety in the Protocol Buffer library follows a simple rule:
// unless explicitly noted otherwise, it is always safe to use an object
// from multiple threads simultaneously as long as the object is declared
// const in all threads (or, it is only used in ways that would be allowed
// if it were declared const).  However, if an object is accessed in one
// thread in a way that would not be allowed if it were const, then it is
// not safe to access that object in any other thread simultaneously.
//
// Put simply, read-only access to an object can happen in multiple threads
// simultaneously, but write access can only happen in a single thread at
// a time.
//
// The implementation does contain some "const" methods which actually modify
// the object behind the scenes -- e.g., to cache results -- but in these cases
// mutex locking is used to make the access thread-safe.
