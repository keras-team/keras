This module contains the functionality to arrange the nodes of a
diagram on an abstract grid, and then to produce a graphical
representation of the grid.

The currently supported back-ends are Xy-pic [Xypic].

Layout Algorithm
================

This section provides an overview of the algorithms implemented in
:class:`DiagramGrid` to lay out diagrams.

The first step of the algorithm is the removal composite and identity
morphisms which do not have properties in the supplied diagram.  The
premises and conclusions of the diagram are then merged.

The generic layout algorithm begins with the construction of the
"skeleton" of the diagram.  The skeleton is an undirected graph which
has the objects of the diagram as vertices and has an (undirected)
edge between each pair of objects between which there exist morphisms.
The direction of the morphisms does not matter at this stage.  The
skeleton also includes an edge between each pair of vertices `A` and
`C` such that there exists an object `B` which is connected via
a morphism to `A`, and via a morphism to `C`.

The skeleton constructed in this way has the property that every
object is a vertex of a triangle formed by three edges of the
skeleton.  This property lies at the base of the generic layout
algorithm.

After the skeleton has been constructed, the algorithm lists all
triangles which can be formed.  Note that some triangles will not have
all edges corresponding to morphisms which will actually be drawn.
Triangles which have only one edge or less which will actually be
drawn are immediately discarded.

The list of triangles is sorted according to the number of edges which
correspond to morphisms, then the triangle with the least number of such
edges is selected.  One of such edges is picked and the corresponding
objects are placed horizontally, on a grid.  This edge is recorded to
be in the fringe.  The algorithm then finds a "welding" of a triangle
to the fringe.  A welding is an edge in the fringe where a triangle
could be attached.  If the algorithm succeeds in finding such a
welding, it adds to the grid that vertex of the triangle which was not
yet included in any edge in the fringe and records the two new edges in
the fringe.  This process continues iteratively until all objects of
the diagram has been placed or until no more weldings can be found.

An edge is only removed from the fringe when a welding to this edge
has been found, and there is no room around this edge to place
another vertex.

When no more weldings can be found, but there are still triangles
left, the algorithm searches for a possibility of attaching one of the
remaining triangles to the existing structure by a vertex.  If such a
possibility is found, the corresponding edge of the found triangle is
placed in the found space and the iterative process of welding
triangles restarts.

When logical groups are supplied, each of these groups is laid out
independently.  Then a diagram is constructed in which groups are
objects and any two logical groups between which there exist morphisms
are connected via a morphism.  This diagram is laid out.  Finally,
the grid which includes all objects of the initial diagram is
constructed by replacing the cells which contain logical groups with
the corresponding laid out grids, and by correspondingly expanding the
rows and columns.

The sequential layout algorithm begins by constructing the
underlying undirected graph defined by the morphisms obtained after
simplifying premises and conclusions and merging them (see above).
The vertex with the minimal degree is then picked up and depth-first
search is started from it.  All objects which are located at distance
`n` from the root in the depth-first search tree, are positioned in
the `n`-th column of the resulting grid.  The sequential layout will
therefore attempt to lay the objects out along a line.

class DiagramGrid:
    r"""
    Constructs and holds the fitting of the diagram into a grid.

    Explanation
    ===========

    The mission of this class is to analyse the structure of the
    supplied diagram and to place its objects on a grid such that,
    when the objects and the morphisms are actually drawn, the diagram
    would be "readable", in the sense that there will not be many
    intersections of moprhisms.  This class does not perform any
    actual drawing.  It does strive nevertheless to offer sufficient
    metadata to draw a diagram.

    Consider the following simple diagram.

    >>> from sympy.categories import Object, NamedMorphism
    >>> from sympy.categories import Diagram, DiagramGrid
    >>> from sympy import pprint
    >>> A = Object("A")
    >>> B = Object("B")
    >>> C = Object("C")
    >>> f = NamedMorphism(A, B, "f")
    >>> g = NamedMorphism(B, C, "g")
    >>> diagram = Diagram([f, g])

    The simplest way to have a diagram laid out is the following:

    >>> grid = DiagramGrid(diagram)
    >>> (grid.width, grid.height)
    (2, 2)
    >>> pprint(grid)
    A  B
    <BLANKLINE>
       C

    Sometimes one sees the diagram as consisting of logical groups.
    One can advise ``DiagramGrid`` as to such groups by employing the
    ``groups`` keyword argument.

    Consider the following diagram:

    >>> D = Object("D")
    >>> f = NamedMorphism(A, B, "f")
    >>> g = NamedMorphism(B, C, "g")
    >>> h = NamedMorphism(D, A, "h")
    >>> k = NamedMorphism(D, B, "k")
    >>> diagram = Diagram([f, g, h, k])

    Lay it out with generic layout:

    >>> grid = DiagramGrid(diagram)
    >>> pprint(grid)
    A  B  D
    <BLANKLINE>
       C

    Now, we can group the objects `A` and `D` to have them near one
    another:

    >>> grid = DiagramGrid(diagram, groups=[[A, D], B, C])
    >>> pprint(grid)
    B     C
    <BLANKLINE>
    A  D

    Note how the positioning of the other objects changes.

    Further indications can be supplied to the constructor of
    :class:`DiagramGrid` using keyword arguments.  The currently
    supported hints are explained in the following paragraphs.

    :class:`DiagramGrid` does not automatically guess which layout
    would suit the supplied diagram better.  Consider, for example,
    the following linear diagram:

    >>> E = Object("E")
    >>> f = NamedMorphism(A, B, "f")
    >>> g = NamedMorphism(B, C, "g")
    >>> h = NamedMorphism(C, D, "h")
    >>> i = NamedMorphism(D, E, "i")
    >>> diagram = Diagram([f, g, h, i])

    When laid out with the generic layout, it does not get to look
    linear:

    >>> grid = DiagramGrid(diagram)
    >>> pprint(grid)
    A  B
    <BLANKLINE>
       C  D
    <BLANKLINE>
          E

    To get it laid out in a line, use ``layout="sequential"``:

    >>> grid = DiagramGrid(diagram, layout="sequential")
    >>> pprint(grid)
    A  B  C  D  E

    One may sometimes need to transpose the resulting layout.  While
    this can always be done by hand, :class:`DiagramGrid` provides a
    hint for that purpose:

    >>> grid = DiagramGrid(diagram, layout="sequential", transpose=True)
    >>> pprint(grid)
    A
    <BLANKLINE>
    B
    <BLANKLINE>
    C
    <BLANKLINE>
    D
    <BLANKLINE>
    E

    Separate hints can also be provided for each group.  For an
    example, refer to ``tests/test_drawing.py``, and see the different
    ways in which the five lemma [FiveLemma] can be laid out.

class ArrowStringDescription:
    r"""
    Stores the information necessary for producing an Xy-pic
    description of an arrow.

    The principal goal of this class is to abstract away the string
    representation of an arrow and to also provide the functionality
    to produce the actual Xy-pic string.

    ``unit`` sets the unit which will be used to specify the amount of
    curving and other distances.  ``horizontal_direction`` should be a
    string of ``"r"`` or ``"l"`` specifying the horizontal offset of the
    target cell of the arrow relatively to the current one.
    ``vertical_direction`` should  specify the vertical offset using a
    series of either ``"d"`` or ``"u"``.  ``label_position`` should be
    either ``"^"``, ``"_"``,  or ``"|"`` to specify that the label should
    be positioned above the arrow, below the arrow or just over the arrow,
    in a break.  Note that the notions "above" and "below" are relative
    to arrow direction.  ``label`` stores the morphism label.

    This works as follows (disregard the yet unexplained arguments):

    >>> from sympy.categories.diagram_drawing import ArrowStringDescription
    >>> astr = ArrowStringDescription(
    ... unit="mm", curving=None, curving_amount=None,
    ... looping_start=None, looping_end=None, horizontal_direction="d",
    ... vertical_direction="r", label_position="_", label="f")
    >>> print(str(astr))
    \ar[dr]_{f}

    ``curving`` should be one of ``"^"``, ``"_"`` to specify in which
    direction the arrow is going to curve. ``curving_amount`` is a number
    describing how many ``unit``'s the morphism is going to curve:

    >>> astr = ArrowStringDescription(
    ... unit="mm", curving="^", curving_amount=12,
    ... looping_start=None, looping_end=None, horizontal_direction="d",
    ... vertical_direction="r", label_position="_", label="f")
    >>> print(str(astr))
    \ar@/^12mm/[dr]_{f}

    ``looping_start`` and ``looping_end`` are currently only used for
    loop morphisms, those which have the same domain and codomain.
    These two attributes should store a valid Xy-pic direction and
    specify, correspondingly, the direction the arrow gets out into
    and the direction the arrow gets back from:

    >>> astr = ArrowStringDescription(
    ... unit="mm", curving=None, curving_amount=None,
    ... looping_start="u", looping_end="l", horizontal_direction="",
    ... vertical_direction="", label_position="_", label="f")
    >>> print(str(astr))
    \ar@(u,l)[]_{f}

    ``label_displacement`` controls how far the arrow label is from
    the ends of the arrow.  For example, to position the arrow label
    near the arrow head, use ">":

    >>> astr = ArrowStringDescription(
    ... unit="mm", curving="^", curving_amount=12,
    ... looping_start=None, looping_end=None, horizontal_direction="d",
    ... vertical_direction="r", label_position="_", label="f")
    >>> astr.label_displacement = ">"
    >>> print(str(astr))
    \ar@/^12mm/[dr]_>{f}

    Finally, ``arrow_style`` is used to specify the arrow style.  To
    get a dashed arrow, for example, use "{-->}" as arrow style:

    >>> astr = ArrowStringDescription(
    ... unit="mm", curving="^", curving_amount=12,
    ... looping_start=None, looping_end=None, horizontal_direction="d",
    ... vertical_direction="r", label_position="_", label="f")
    >>> astr.arrow_style = "{-->}"
    >>> print(str(astr))
    \ar@/^12mm/@{-->}[dr]_{f}

class XypicDiagramDrawer:
    r"""
    Given a :class:`~.Diagram` and the corresponding
    :class:`DiagramGrid`, produces the Xy-pic representation of the
    diagram.

    The most important method in this class is ``draw``.  Consider the
    following triangle diagram:

    >>> from sympy.categories import Object, NamedMorphism, Diagram
    >>> from sympy.categories import DiagramGrid, XypicDiagramDrawer
    >>> A = Object("A")
    >>> B = Object("B")
    >>> C = Object("C")
    >>> f = NamedMorphism(A, B, "f")
    >>> g = NamedMorphism(B, C, "g")
    >>> diagram = Diagram([f, g], {g * f: "unique"})

    To draw this diagram, its objects need to be laid out with a
    :class:`DiagramGrid`::

    >>> grid = DiagramGrid(diagram)

    Finally, the drawing:

    >>> drawer = XypicDiagramDrawer()
    >>> print(drawer.draw(diagram, grid))
    \xymatrix{
    A \ar[d]_{g\circ f} \ar[r]^{f} & B \ar[ld]^{g} \\
    C &
    }

    For further details see the docstring of this method.

    To control the appearance of the arrows, formatters are used.  The
    dictionary ``arrow_formatters`` maps morphisms to formatter
    functions.  A formatter is accepts an
    :class:`ArrowStringDescription` and is allowed to modify any of
    the arrow properties exposed thereby.  For example, to have all
    morphisms with the property ``unique`` appear as dashed arrows,
    and to have their names prepended with `\exists !`, the following
    should be done:

    To modify the appearance of all arrows in the diagram, set
    ``default_arrow_formatter``.  For example, to place all morphism
    labels a little bit farther from the arrow head so that they look
    more centred, do as follows:

    >>> def default_formatter(astr):
    ...   astr.label_displacement = "(0.45)"
    >>> drawer.default_arrow_formatter = default_formatter
    >>> print(drawer.draw(diagram, grid))
    \xymatrix{
    A \ar@{-->}[d]_(0.45){\exists !g\circ f} \ar[r]^(0.45){f} & B \ar[ld]^(0.45){g} \\
    C &
    }

    In some diagrams some morphisms are drawn as curved arrows.
    Consider the following diagram:

    >>> D = Object("D")
    >>> E = Object("E")
    >>> h = NamedMorphism(D, A, "h")
    >>> k = NamedMorphism(D, B, "k")
    >>> diagram = Diagram([f, g, h, k])
    >>> grid = DiagramGrid(diagram)
    >>> drawer = XypicDiagramDrawer()
    >>> print(drawer.draw(diagram, grid))
    \xymatrix{
    A \ar[r]_{f} & B \ar[d]^{g} & D \ar[l]^{k} \ar@/_3mm/[ll]_{h} \\
    & C &
    }

    To control how far the morphisms are curved by default, one can
    use the ``unit`` and ``default_curving_amount`` attributes:

    >>> drawer.unit = "cm"
    >>> drawer.default_curving_amount = 1
    >>> print(drawer.draw(diagram, grid))
    \xymatrix{
    A \ar[r]_{f} & B \ar[d]^{g} & D \ar[l]^{k} \ar@/_1cm/[ll]_{h} \\
    & C &
    }

    In some diagrams, there are multiple curved morphisms between the
    same two objects.  To control by how much the curving changes
    between two such successive morphisms, use
    ``default_curving_step``:

    >>> drawer.default_curving_step = 1
    >>> h1 = NamedMorphism(A, D, "h1")
    >>> diagram = Diagram([f, g, h, k, h1])
    >>> grid = DiagramGrid(diagram)
    >>> print(drawer.draw(diagram, grid))
    \xymatrix{
    A \ar[r]_{f} \ar@/^1cm/[rr]^{h_{1}} & B \ar[d]^{g} & D \ar[l]^{k} \ar@/_2cm/[ll]_{h} \\
    & C &
    }

    The default value of ``default_curving_step`` is 4 units.

        Returns the Xy-pic representation of ``diagram`` laid out in
        ``grid``.

        Consider the following simple triangle diagram.

        >>> from sympy.categories import Object, NamedMorphism, Diagram
        >>> from sympy.categories import DiagramGrid, XypicDiagramDrawer
        >>> A = Object("A")
        >>> B = Object("B")
        >>> C = Object("C")
        >>> f = NamedMorphism(A, B, "f")
        >>> g = NamedMorphism(B, C, "g")
        >>> diagram = Diagram([f, g], {g * f: "unique"})

        To draw this diagram, its objects need to be laid out with a
        :class:`DiagramGrid`::

        >>> grid = DiagramGrid(diagram)

        Finally, the drawing:

        >>> drawer = XypicDiagramDrawer()
        >>> print(drawer.draw(diagram, grid))
        \xymatrix{
        A \ar[d]_{g\circ f} \ar[r]^{f} & B \ar[ld]^{g} \\
        C &
        }

        The argument ``masked`` can be used to skip morphisms in the
        presentation of the diagram:

        >>> print(drawer.draw(diagram, grid, masked=[g * f]))
        \xymatrix{
        A \ar[r]^{f} & B \ar[ld]^{g} \\
        C &
        }

        Finally, the ``diagram_format`` argument can be used to
        specify the format string of the diagram.  For example, to
        increase the spacing by 1 cm, proceeding as follows:

        >>> print(drawer.draw(diagram, grid, diagram_format="@+1cm"))
        \xymatrix@+1cm{
        A \ar[d]_{g\circ f} \ar[r]^{f} & B \ar[ld]^{g} \\
        C &
        }

        """
        # This method works in several steps.  It starts by removing
        # the masked morphisms, if necessary, and then maps objects to
        # their positions in the grid (coordinate tuples).  Remember
        # that objects are unique in ``Diagram`` and in the layout
        # produced by ``DiagramGrid``, so every object is mapped to a
        # single coordinate pair.
        #
        # The next step is the central step and is concerned with
        # analysing the morphisms of the diagram and deciding how to
        # draw them.  For example, how to curve the arrows is decided
        # at this step.  The bulk of the analysis is implemented in
        # ``_process_morphism``, to the result of which the
        # appropriate formatters are applied.
        #
        # The result of the previous step is a list of
        # ``ArrowStringDescription``.  After the analysis and
        # application of formatters, some extra logic tries to assure
        # better positioning of morphism labels (for example, an
        # attempt is made to avoid the situations when arrows cross
        # labels).  This functionality constitutes the next step and
        # is implemented in ``_push_labels_out``.  Note that label
        # positions which have been set via a formatter are not
        # affected in this step.
        #
        # Finally, at the closing step, the array of
        # ``ArrowStringDescription`` and the layout information
        # incorporated in ``DiagramGrid`` are combined to produce the
        # resulting Xy-pic picture.  This part of code lies in
