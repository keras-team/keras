              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and

                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and

              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/ml_dtypes.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/ml_dtypes)

`ml_dtypes` is a stand-alone implementation of several NumPy dtype extensions used in machine learning libraries, including:

- [`bfloat16`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bfloat16_floating-point_format):
  an alternative to the standard [`float16`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-precision_floating-point_format) format
- 8-bit floating point representations, parameterized by number of exponent and
  mantissa bits, as well as the bias (if any) and representability of infinity,
  NaN, and signed zero.
  * `float8_e3m4`
  * `float8_e4m3`
  * `float8_e4m3b11fnuz`
  * `float8_e4m3fn`
  * `float8_e4m3fnuz`
  * `float8_e5m2`
  * `float8_e5m2fnuz`
  * `float8_e8m0fnu`
- Microscaling (MX) sub-byte floating point representations:
  * `float4_e2m1fn`

  * `float6_e3m2fn`
- Narrow integer encodings:
  * `int2`
  * `int4`
  * `uint2`
  * `uint4`

See below for specifications of these number formats.

## Installation

The `ml_dtypes` package is tested with Python versions 3.9-3.12, and can be installed
with the following command:
```
pip install ml_dtypes
```
To test your installation, you can run the following:
```
pip install absl-py pytest
pytest --pyargs ml_dtypes
```
To build from source, clone the repository and run:
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
pip install .
```

## Example Usage

```python
>>> from ml_dtypes import bfloat16
>>> import numpy as np
>>> np.zeros(4, dtype=bfloat16)
array([0, 0, 0, 0], dtype=bfloat16)
```
Importing `ml_dtypes` also registers the data types with numpy, so that they may
be referred to by their string name:

```python
>>> np.dtype('bfloat16')
dtype(bfloat16)
>>> np.dtype('float8_e5m2')
dtype(float8_e5m2)
```

## Specifications of implemented floating point formats

### `bfloat16`

A `bfloat16` number is a single-precision float truncated at 16 bits.

Exponent: 8, Mantissa: 7, exponent bias: 127. IEEE 754, with NaN and inf.

### `float4_e2m1fn`

Exponent: 2, Mantissa: 1, bias: 1.

Extended range: no inf, no NaN.

Microscaling format, 4 bits (encoding: `0bSEEM`) using byte storage (higher 4
bits are unused). NaN representation is undefined.

Possible absolute values: [`0`, `0.5`, `1`, `1.5`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `6`]

### `float6_e2m3fn`

Exponent: 2, Mantissa: 3, bias: 1.

Extended range: no inf, no NaN.

Microscaling format, 6 bits (encoding: `0bSEEMMM`) using byte storage (higher 2
bits are unused). NaN representation is undefined.

Possible values range: [`-7.5`; `7.5`]

### `float6_e3m2fn`

Exponent: 3, Mantissa: 2, bias: 3.

Extended range: no inf, no NaN.

Microscaling format, 4 bits (encoding: `0bSEEEMM`) using byte storage (higher 2
bits are unused). NaN representation is undefined.

Possible values range: [`-28`; `28`]

### `float8_e3m4`

Exponent: 3, Mantissa: 4, bias: 3. IEEE 754, with NaN and inf.

### `float8_e4m3`

Exponent: 4, Mantissa: 3, bias: 7. IEEE 754, with NaN and inf.

### `float8_e4m3b11fnuz`

Exponent: 4, Mantissa: 3, bias: 11.

Extended range: no inf, NaN represented by 0b1000'0000.

### `float8_e4m3fn`

Exponent: 4, Mantissa: 3, bias: 7.

Extended range: no inf, NaN represented by 0bS111'1111.

The `fn` suffix is for consistency with the corresponding LLVM/MLIR type, signaling this type is not consistent with IEEE-754.  The `f` indicates it is finite values only. The `n` indicates it includes NaNs, but only at the outer range.

### `float8_e4m3fnuz`

8-bit floating point with 3 bit mantissa.

An 8-bit floating point type with 1 sign bit, 4 bits exponent and 3 bits mantissa. The suffix `fnuz` is consistent with LLVM/MLIR naming and is derived from the differences to IEEE floating point conventions. `F` is for "finite" (no infinities), `N` for with special NaN encoding, `UZ` for unsigned zero.

This type has the following characteristics:
 * bit encoding: S1E4M3 - `0bSEEEEMMM`
 * exponent bias: 8
 * infinities: Not supported
 * NaNs: Supported with sign bit set to 1, exponent bits and mantissa bits set to all 0s - `0b10000000`
 * denormals when exponent is 0

### `float8_e5m2`

Exponent: 5, Mantissa: 2, bias: 15. IEEE 754, with NaN and inf.

### `float8_e5m2fnuz`

8-bit floating point with 2 bit mantissa.

An 8-bit floating point type with 1 sign bit, 5 bits exponent and 2 bits mantissa. The suffix `fnuz` is consistent with LLVM/MLIR naming and is derived from the differences to IEEE floating point conventions. `F` is for "finite" (no infinities), `N` for with special NaN encoding, `UZ` for unsigned zero.

This type has the following characteristics:
 * bit encoding: S1E5M2 - `0bSEEEEEMM`
 * exponent bias: 16
 * infinities: Not supported
 * NaNs: Supported with sign bit set to 1, exponent bits and mantissa bits set to all 0s - `0b10000000`
 * denormals when exponent is 0

### `float8_e8m0fnu`

[OpenCompute MX](https://www.opencompute.org/documents/ocp-microscaling-formats-mx-v1-0-spec-final-pdf)
scale format E8M0, which has the following properties:
  * Unsigned format
  * 8 exponent bits
  * Exponent range from -127 to 127
  * No zero and infinity
  * Single NaN value (0xFF).

## `int2`, `int4`, `uint2` and `uint4`

2 and 4-bit integer types, where each element is represented unpacked (i.e.,
padded up to a byte in memory).

NumPy does not support types smaller than a single byte: for example, the
distance between adjacent elements in an array (`.strides`) is expressed as
an integer number of bytes. Relaxing this restriction would be a considerable
engineering project. These types therefore use an unpacked representation, where
each element of the array is padded up to a byte in memory. The lower two or four
bits of each byte contain the representation of the number, whereas the remaining
upper bits are ignored.

## Quirks of low-precision Arithmetic

If you're exploring the use of low-precision dtypes in your code, you should be
careful to anticipate when the precision loss might lead to surprising results.
One example is the behavior of aggregations like `sum`; consider this `bfloat16`
summation in NumPy (run with version 1.24.2):

```python
>>> from ml_dtypes import bfloat16
>>> import numpy as np
>>> rng = np.random.default_rng(seed=0)
>>> vals = rng.uniform(size=10000).astype(bfloat16)
>>> vals.sum()
256
```
The true sum should be close to 5000, but numpy returns exactly 256: this is
because `bfloat16` does not have the precision to increment `256` by values less than
`1`:

```python
>>> bfloat16(256) + bfloat16(1)
256
```
After 256, the next representable value in bfloat16 is 258:

```python
>>> np.nextafter(bfloat16(256), bfloat16(np.inf))
258
```
For better results you can specify that the accumulation should happen in a
higher-precision type like `float32`:

```python
>>> vals.sum(dtype='float32').astype(bfloat16)
4992
```
In contrast to NumPy, projects like [JAX](http://jax.readthedocs.io/) which support
low-precision arithmetic more natively will often do these kinds of higher-precision
accumulations automatically:

```python
>>> import jax.numpy as jnp
>>> jnp.array(vals).sum()
Array(4992, dtype=bfloat16)
```
