"""A file interface for handling local and remote data files.

The goal of datasource is to abstract some of the file system operations
when dealing with data files so the researcher doesn't have to know all the
low-level details.  Through datasource, a researcher can obtain and use a
file with one function call, regardless of location of the file.

DataSource is meant to augment standard python libraries, not replace them.
It should work seamlessly with standard file IO operations and the os
module.

DataSource files can originate locally or remotely:

- local files : '/home/guido/src/local/data.txt'
- URLs (http, ftp, ...) : 'http://www.scipy.org/not/real/data.txt'

DataSource files can also be compressed or uncompressed.  Currently only
gzip, bz2 and xz are supported.

Example::

    >>> # Create a DataSource, use os.curdir (default) for local storage.
    >>> from numpy import DataSource
    >>> ds = DataSource()
    >>>
    >>> # Open a remote file.
    >>> # DataSource downloads the file, stores it locally in:
    >>> #     './www.google.com/index.html'
    >>> # opens the file and returns a file object.
    >>> fp = ds.open('http://www.google.com/') # doctest: +SKIP
    >>>
    >>> # Use the file as you normally would
    >>> fp.read() # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> fp.close() # doctest: +SKIP

    DataSources can be local files or remote files/URLs.  The files may

        using the `open` method.

        Parameters
        ----------
        path : str or pathlib.Path
            Can be a local file or a remote URL. This may, but does not
            have to, include the `baseurl` with which the `Repository` was
            initialized.

        Returns
        -------
        out : str
            Complete path, including the `DataSource` destination directory.

        """
        return DataSource.abspath(self, self._fullpath(path))

    def exists(self, path):
        """
        Test if path exists prepending Repository base URL to path.

        Test if `path` exists as (and in this order):

        - a local file.
        - a remote URL that has been downloaded and stored locally in the
          `DataSource` directory.
        - a remote URL that has not been downloaded, but is valid and
          accessible.

        Parameters
        ----------
        path : str or pathlib.Path
            Can be a local file or a remote URL. This may, but does not
            have to, include the `baseurl` with which the `Repository` was
            initialized.

        Returns
        -------
        out : bool
            True if `path` exists.

        Notes
        -----
        When `path` is an URL, `exists` will return True if it's either
        stored locally in the `DataSource` directory, or is a valid remote
        URL.  `DataSource` does not discriminate between the two, the file
        is accessible if it exists in either location.

        """
        return DataSource.exists(self, self._fullpath(path))

    def open(self, path, mode='r', encoding=None, newline=None):
        """
        Open and return file-like object prepending Repository base URL.

        If `path` is an URL, it will be downloaded, stored in the
        DataSource directory and opened from there.

        Parameters
        ----------
        path : str or pathlib.Path
            Local file path or URL to open. This may, but does not have to,
            include the `baseurl` with which the `Repository` was
            initialized.
        mode : {'r', 'w', 'a'}, optional
            Mode to open `path`.  Mode 'r' for reading, 'w' for writing,
            'a' to append. Available modes depend on the type of object
            specified by `path`. Default is 'r'.
        encoding : {None, str}, optional
            Open text file with given encoding. The default encoding will be
            what `open` uses.
        newline : {None, str}, optional
            Newline to use when reading text file.

        Returns
        -------
        out : file object
            File object.

        """
        return DataSource.open(self, self._fullpath(path), mode,

    def listdir(self):
        """
        List files in the source Repository.

        Returns
        -------
        files : list of str or pathlib.Path
            List of file names (not containing a directory part).

        Notes
        -----
        Does not currently work for remote repositories.
