Chebyshev Series (:mod:`numpy.polynomial.chebyshev`)
====================================================

This module provides a number of objects (mostly functions) useful for
dealing with Chebyshev series, including a `Chebyshev` class that
encapsulates the usual arithmetic operations.  (General information
on how this module represents and works with such polynomials is in the
docstring for its "parent" sub-package, `numpy.polynomial`).

Notes
-----
The implementations of multiplication, division, integration, and
differentiation use the algebraic identities [1]_:

.. math::
    T_n(x) = \\frac{z^n + z^{-n}}{2} \\\\
    z\\frac{dx}{dz} = \\frac{z - z^{-1}}{2}.

where

.. math:: x = \\frac{z + z^{-1}}{2}.

These identities allow a Chebyshev series to be expressed as a finite,
symmetric Laurent series.  In this module, this sort of Laurent series
is referred to as a "z-series."

    In general, the (polynomial) division of one C-series by another
    results in quotient and remainder terms that are not in the Chebyshev
    polynomial basis set.  Thus, to express these results as C-series, it
    is typically necessary to "reproject" the results onto said basis
    set, which typically produces "unintuitive" (but correct) results;
    see Examples section below.

    -------
    S : ndarray
        C-series coefficients of the integral.

    ------
    ValueError

    --------

    Notes
    -----
    Note that the result of each integration is *multiplied* by `scl`.
    Why is this important to note?  Say one is making a linear change of
    variable :math:`u = ax + b` in an integral relative to `x`.  Then
    :math:`dx = du/a`, so one will need to set `scl` equal to
    :math:`1/a`- perhaps not what one would have first thought.

    to be "reprojected" onto the C-series basis set.  Thus, typically,
    the result of this function is "unintuitive," albeit correct; see

def chebgrid3d(x, y, z, c):
    """
    Evaluate a 3-D Chebyshev series on the Cartesian product of x, y, and z.

    This function returns the values:

    .. math:: p(a,b,c) = \\sum_{i,j,k} c_{i,j,k} * T_i(a) * T_j(b) * T_k(c)

    where the points ``(a, b, c)`` consist of all triples formed by taking
    `a` from `x`, `b` from `y`, and `c` from `z`. The resulting points form
    a grid with `x` in the first dimension, `y` in the second, and `z` in
    the third.

    The parameters `x`, `y`, and `z` are converted to arrays only if they
    are tuples or a lists, otherwise they are treated as a scalars. In
    either case, either `x`, `y`, and `z` or their elements must support
    multiplication and addition both with themselves and with the elements
    of `c`.

    If `c` has fewer than three dimensions, ones are implicitly appended to
    its shape to make it 3-D. The shape of the result will be c.shape[3:] +
    x.shape + y.shape + z.shape.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y, z : array_like, compatible objects
        The three dimensional series is evaluated at the points in the
        Cartesian product of `x`, `y`, and `z`.  If `x`, `y`, or `z` is a
        list or tuple, it is first converted to an ndarray, otherwise it is
        left unchanged and, if it isn't an ndarray, it is treated as a
        scalar.
    c : array_like
        Array of coefficients ordered so that the coefficients for terms of
        degree i,j are contained in ``c[i,j]``. If `c` has dimension
        greater than two the remaining indices enumerate multiple sets of
        coefficients.

    Returns
    -------

        The values of the two dimensional polynomial at points in the Cartesian
        product of `x` and `y`.

    y : array_like, shape (M,) or (M, K)
        y-coordinates of the sample points. Several data sets of sample

    deg : int or 1-D array_like
        Degree(s) of the fitting polynomials. If `deg` is a single integer,
        all terms up to and including the `deg`'th term are included in the

    rcond : float, optional

    w : array_like, shape (`M`,), optional
        Weights. If not None, the weight ``w[i]`` applies to the unsquared

    Notes
    -----
    The solution is the coefficients of the Chebyshev series `p` that
    minimizes the sum of the weighted squared errors

    .. math:: E = \\sum_j w_j^2 * |y_j - p(x_j)|^2,

    where :math:`w_j` are the weights. This problem is solved by setting up
    as the (typically) overdetermined matrix equation

    .. math:: V(x) * c = w * y,

    where `V` is the weighted pseudo Vandermonde matrix of `x`, `c` are the
    coefficients to be solved for, `w` are the weights, and `y` are the
    observed values.  This equation is then solved using the singular value
    decomposition of `V`.

    If some of the singular values of `V` are so small that they are
    neglected, then a `~exceptions.RankWarning` will be issued. This means that
    the coefficient values may be poorly determined. Using a lower order fit
    will usually get rid of the warning.  The `rcond` parameter can also be
    set to a value smaller than its default, but the resulting fit may be
    spurious and have large contributions from roundoff error.

    Fits using Chebyshev series are usually better conditioned than fits
    using power series, but much can depend on the distribution of the
    sample points and the smoothness of the data. If the quality of the fit
    is inadequate splines may be a good alternative.

    -----
    The root estimates are obtained as the eigenvalues of the companion
    matrix, Roots far from the origin of the complex plane may have large
    errors due to the numerical instability of the series for such
    values. Roots with multiplicity greater than 1 will also show larger
    errors as the value of the series near such points is relatively
    insensitive to errors in the roots. Isolated roots near the origin can

    The Chebyshev class provides the standard Python numerical methods

    attributes and methods listed below.

    Parameters
    ----------
    coef : array_like
        Chebyshev coefficients in order of increasing degree, i.e.,
        ``(1, 2, 3)`` gives ``1*T_0(x) + 2*T_1(x) + 3*T_2(x)``.
    domain : (2,) array_like, optional
        Domain to use. The interval ``[domain[0], domain[1]]`` is mapped
        to the interval ``[window[0], window[1]]`` by shifting and scaling.
        The default value is [-1, 1].
    window : (2,) array_like, optional
        Window, see `domain` for its use. The default value is [-1, 1].

        .. versionadded:: 1.6.0
    symbol : str, optional
        Symbol used to represent the independent variable in string
        representations of the polynomial expression, e.g. for printing.
        The symbol must be a valid Python identifier. Default value is 'x'.

        domain : {None, [beg, end]}, optional
