    Return the directory that contains the ``fortranobject.c`` and ``.h`` files.

    .. note::

        This function is not needed when building an extension with
        `numpy.distutils` directly from ``.f`` and/or ``.pyf`` files
        in one go.

    Python extension modules built with f2py-generated code need to use
    ``fortranobject.c`` as a source file, and include the ``fortranobject.h``
    header. This function can be used to obtain the directory containing
    both of these files.

    Returns
    -------
    include_path : str
        Absolute path to the directory containing ``fortranobject.c`` and
        ``fortranobject.h``.

    Notes
    -----
    .. versionadded:: 1.21.1

    Unless the build system you are using has specific support for f2py,
    building a Python extension using a ``.pyf`` signature file is a two-step
    process. For a module ``mymod``:

    * Step 1: run ``python -m numpy.f2py mymod.pyf --quiet``. This
      generates ``mymodmodule.c`` and (if needed)
      ``mymod-f2pywrappers.f`` files next to ``mymod.pyf``.
    * Step 2: build your Python extension module. This requires the
      following source files:

      * ``mymodmodule.c``
      * ``mymod-f2pywrappers.f`` (if it was generated in Step 1)
      * ``fortranobject.c``
