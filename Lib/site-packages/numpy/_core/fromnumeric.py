@array_function_dispatch(_take_dispatcher)
def take(a, indices, axis=None, out=None, mode='raise'):
    """
    Take elements from an array along an axis.

    When axis is not None, this function does the same thing as "fancy"
    indexing (indexing arrays using arrays); however, it can be easier to use
    if you need elements along a given axis. A call such as
    ``np.take(arr, indices, axis=3)`` is equivalent to
    ``arr[:,:,:,indices,...]``.

    Explained without fancy indexing, this is equivalent to the following use
    of `ndindex`, which sets each of ``ii``, ``jj``, and ``kk`` to a tuple of
    indices::

        Ni, Nk = a.shape[:axis], a.shape[axis+1:]
        Nj = indices.shape
        for ii in ndindex(Ni):
            for jj in ndindex(Nj):
                for kk in ndindex(Nk):
                    out[ii + jj + kk] = a[ii + (indices[jj],) + kk]

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like (Ni..., M, Nk...)
        The source array.
    indices : array_like (Nj...)
        The indices of the values to extract.

        .. versionadded:: 1.8.0

        Also allow scalars for indices.
    axis : int, optional
        The axis over which to select values. By default, the flattened
        input array is used.
    out : ndarray, optional (Ni..., Nj..., Nk...)
        If provided, the result will be placed in this array. It should
        be of the appropriate shape and dtype. Note that `out` is always
        buffered if `mode='raise'`; use other modes for better performance.
    mode : {'raise', 'wrap', 'clip'}, optional
        Specifies how out-of-bounds indices will behave.

        * 'raise' -- raise an error (default)
        * 'wrap' -- wrap around
        * 'clip' -- clip to the range

        'clip' mode means that all indices that are too large are replaced
        by the index that addresses the last element along that axis. Note
        that this disables indexing with negative numbers.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray (Ni..., Nj..., Nk...)
        The returned array has the same type as `a`.

    See Also
    --------
    compress : Take elements using a boolean mask
    ndarray.take : equivalent method
    take_along_axis : Take elements by matching the array and the index arrays

    Notes
    -----

    By eliminating the inner loop in the description above, and using `s_` to
    build simple slice objects, `take` can be expressed  in terms of applying
    fancy indexing to each 1-d slice::

        Ni, Nk = a.shape[:axis], a.shape[axis+1:]
        for ii in ndindex(Ni):
            for kk in ndindex(Nj):
                out[ii + s_[...,] + kk] = a[ii + s_[:,] + kk][indices]

    For this reason, it is equivalent to (but faster than) the following use
    of `apply_along_axis`::

        out = np.apply_along_axis(lambda a_1d: a_1d[indices], axis, a)

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = [4, 3, 5, 7, 6, 8]
    >>> indices = [0, 1, 4]
    >>> np.take(a, indices)
    array([4, 3, 6])

    In this example if `a` is an ndarray, "fancy" indexing can be used.

    >>> a = np.array(a)
    >>> a[indices]
    array([4, 3, 6])

    If `indices` is not one dimensional, the output also has these dimensions.

    >>> np.take(a, [[0, 1], [2, 3]])
    array([[4, 3],
           [5, 7]])

# not deprecated --- copy if necessary, view otherwise
@array_function_dispatch(_reshape_dispatcher)
def reshape(a, newshape, order='C'):
    """
    Gives a new shape to an array without changing its data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Array to be reshaped.
    newshape : int or tuple of ints
        The new shape should be compatible with the original shape. If
        an integer, then the result will be a 1-D array of that length.
        One shape dimension can be -1. In this case, the value is
        inferred from the length of the array and remaining dimensions.
    order : {'C', 'F', 'A'}, optional
        Read the elements of `a` using this index order, and place the
        elements into the reshaped array using this index order.  'C'
        means to read / write the elements using C-like index order,
        with the last axis index changing fastest, back to the first
        axis index changing slowest. 'F' means to read / write the
        elements using Fortran-like index order, with the first index
        changing fastest, and the last index changing slowest. Note that
        the 'C' and 'F' options take no account of the memory layout of
        the underlying array, and only refer to the order of indexing.
        'A' means to read / write the elements in Fortran-like index
        order if `a` is Fortran *contiguous* in memory, C-like order
        otherwise.

    Returns
    -------
    reshaped_array : ndarray
        This will be a new view object if possible; otherwise, it will
        be a copy.  Note there is no guarantee of the *memory layout* (C- or
        Fortran- contiguous) of the returned array.

    See Also
    --------
    ndarray.reshape : Equivalent method.

    Notes
    -----
    It is not always possible to change the shape of an array without copying
    the data.

    The `order` keyword gives the index ordering both for *fetching* the values
    from `a`, and then *placing* the values into the output array.
    For example, let's say you have an array:

    >>> a = np.arange(6).reshape((3, 2))
    >>> a
    array([[0, 1],
           [2, 3],
           [4, 5]])

    You can think of reshaping as first raveling the array (using the given
    index order), then inserting the elements from the raveled array into the
    new array using the same kind of index ordering as was used for the
    raveling.

    >>> np.reshape(a, (2, 3)) # C-like index ordering
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [3, 4, 5]])
    >>> np.reshape(np.ravel(a), (2, 3)) # equivalent to C ravel then C reshape
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [3, 4, 5]])
    >>> np.reshape(a, (2, 3), order='F') # Fortran-like index ordering
    array([[0, 4, 3],
           [2, 1, 5]])
    >>> np.reshape(np.ravel(a, order='F'), (2, 3), order='F')
    array([[0, 4, 3],
           [2, 1, 5]])

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1,2,3], [4,5,6]])
    >>> np.reshape(a, 6)
    array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])

    array([1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6])

@array_function_dispatch(_choose_dispatcher)
def choose(a, choices, out=None, mode='raise'):
    """
    Construct an array from an index array and a list of arrays to choose from.

    First of all, if confused or uncertain, definitely look at the Examples -
    in its full generality, this function is less simple than it might
    seem from the following code description (below ndi =
    `numpy.lib.index_tricks`):

    ``np.choose(a,c) == np.array([c[a[I]][I] for I in ndi.ndindex(a.shape)])``.

    But this omits some subtleties.  Here is a fully general summary:

    Given an "index" array (`a`) of integers and a sequence of ``n`` arrays
    (`choices`), `a` and each choice array are first broadcast, as necessary,
    to arrays of a common shape; calling these *Ba* and *Bchoices[i], i =
    0,...,n-1* we have that, necessarily, ``Ba.shape == Bchoices[i].shape``
    for each ``i``.  Then, a new array with shape ``Ba.shape`` is created as
    follows:

    * if ``mode='raise'`` (the default), then, first of all, each element of
      ``a`` (and thus ``Ba``) must be in the range ``[0, n-1]``; now, suppose
      that ``i`` (in that range) is the value at the ``(j0, j1, ..., jm)``
      position in ``Ba`` - then the value at the same position in the new array
      is the value in ``Bchoices[i]`` at that same position;

    * if ``mode='wrap'``, values in `a` (and thus `Ba`) may be any (signed)
      integer; modular arithmetic is used to map integers outside the range
      `[0, n-1]` back into that range; and then the new array is constructed
      as above;

    * if ``mode='clip'``, values in `a` (and thus ``Ba``) may be any (signed)
      integer; negative integers are mapped to 0; values greater than ``n-1``
      are mapped to ``n-1``; and then the new array is constructed as above.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : int array
        This array must contain integers in ``[0, n-1]``, where ``n`` is the
        number of choices, unless ``mode=wrap`` or ``mode=clip``, in which
        cases any integers are permissible.
    choices : sequence of arrays
        Choice arrays. `a` and all of the choices must be broadcastable to the
        same shape.  If `choices` is itself an array (not recommended), then
        its outermost dimension (i.e., the one corresponding to
        ``choices.shape[0]``) is taken as defining the "sequence".
    out : array, optional
        If provided, the result will be inserted into this array. It should
        be of the appropriate shape and dtype. Note that `out` is always
        buffered if ``mode='raise'``; use other modes for better performance.
    mode : {'raise' (default), 'wrap', 'clip'}, optional
        Specifies how indices outside ``[0, n-1]`` will be treated:

        * 'raise' : an exception is raised
        * 'wrap' : value becomes value mod ``n``
        * 'clip' : values < 0 are mapped to 0, values > n-1 are mapped to n-1

    Returns
    -------
    merged_array : array
        The merged result.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError: shape mismatch
        If `a` and each choice array are not all broadcastable to the same
        shape.

    See Also
    --------
    ndarray.choose : equivalent method
    numpy.take_along_axis : Preferable if `choices` is an array

    Notes
    -----
    To reduce the chance of misinterpretation, even though the following
    "abuse" is nominally supported, `choices` should neither be, nor be
    thought of as, a single array, i.e., the outermost sequence-like container
    should be either a list or a tuple.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> choices = [[0, 1, 2, 3], [10, 11, 12, 13],
    ...   [20, 21, 22, 23], [30, 31, 32, 33]]
    >>> np.choose([2, 3, 1, 0], choices
    ... # the first element of the result will be the first element of the
    ... # third (2+1) "array" in choices, namely, 20; the second element
    ... # will be the second element of the fourth (3+1) choice array, i.e.,
    ... # 31, etc.
    ... )
    array([20, 31, 12,  3])
    >>> np.choose([2, 4, 1, 0], choices, mode='clip') # 4 goes to 3 (4-1)
    array([20, 31, 12,  3])
    >>> # because there are 4 choice arrays
    >>> np.choose([2, 4, 1, 0], choices, mode='wrap') # 4 goes to (4 mod 4)
    array([20,  1, 12,  3])
    >>> # i.e., 0

    A couple examples illustrating how choose broadcasts:

    >>> a = [[1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1]]
    >>> choices = [-10, 10]
    >>> np.choose(a, choices)

def transpose(a, axes=None):
    """
    Returns an array with axes transposed.

    For a 1-D array, this returns an unchanged view of the original array, as a
    transposed vector is simply the same vector.
    To convert a 1-D array into a 2-D column vector, an additional dimension
    must be added, e.g., ``np.atleast_2d(a).T`` achieves this, as does
    ``a[:, np.newaxis]``.
    For a 2-D array, this is the standard matrix transpose.
    For an n-D array, if axes are given, their order indicates how the
    axes are permuted (see Examples). If axes are not provided, then
    ``transpose(a).shape == a.shape[::-1]``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.
    axes : tuple or list of ints, optional
        If specified, it must be a tuple or list which contains a permutation
        of [0,1,...,N-1] where N is the number of axes of `a`. The `i`'th axis
        of the returned array will correspond to the axis numbered ``axes[i]``
        of the input. If not specified, defaults to ``range(a.ndim)[::-1]``,
        which reverses the order of the axes.

    Returns
    -------
    p : ndarray
        `a` with its axes permuted. A view is returned whenever possible.

    moveaxis : Move axes of an array to new positions.
    argsort : Return the indices that would sort an array.

    Notes
    -----
    Use ``transpose(a, argsort(axes))`` to invert the transposition of tensors
    when using the `axes` keyword argument.

    ndarray.partition : Method to sort an array in-place.
    argpartition : Indirect partition.
    sort : Full sorting

    Notes
    -----
    The various selection algorithms are characterized by their average
    speed, worst case performance, work space size, and whether they are
    stable. A stable sort keeps items with the same key in the same
    relative order. The available algorithms have the following
    properties:

    ================= ======= ============= ============ =======
       kind            speed   worst case    work space  stable
    ================= ======= ============= ============ =======
    'introselect'        1        O(n)           0         no
    ================= ======= ============= ============ =======

    All the partition algorithms make temporary copies of the data when
    partitioning along any but the last axis.  Consequently,
    partitioning along the last axis is faster and uses less space than
    partitioning along any other axis.

    The sort order for complex numbers is lexicographic. If both the
    real and imaginary parts are non-nan then the order is determined by
    the real parts except when they are equal, in which case the order
    is determined by the imaginary parts.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([7, 1, 7, 7, 1, 5, 7, 2, 3, 2, 6, 2, 3, 0])
    >>> p = np.partition(a, 4)
    >>> p
    array([0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 5, 2, 3, 3, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7]) # may vary

    ``p[4]`` is 2;  all elements in ``p[:4]`` are less than or equal
    to ``p[4]``, and all elements in ``p[5:]`` are greater than or
    equal to ``p[4]``.  The partition is::

        [0, 1, 2, 1], [2], [5, 2, 3, 3, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7]

    Notes
    -----
    The various sorting algorithms are characterized by their average speed,

    order. The four algorithms implemented in NumPy have the following

    'timsort'      2     O(n*log(n))      ~n/2        yes
    =========== ======= ============= ============ ========

    .. note:: The datatype determines which of 'mergesort' or 'timsort'
       is actually used, even if 'mergesort' is specified. User selection
       at a finer scale is not currently available.

    For performance, ``sort`` makes a temporary copy if needed to make the data
    `contiguous <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/glossary.html#term-contiguous>`_
    in memory along the sort axis. For even better performance and reduced
    memory consumption, ensure that the array is already contiguous along the
    sort axis.

    The sort order for complex numbers is lexicographic. If both the real
    and imaginary parts are non-nan then the order is determined by the
    real parts except when they are equal, in which case the order is
    determined by the imaginary parts.

    Previous to numpy 1.4.0 sorting real and complex arrays containing nan
    values led to undefined behaviour. In numpy versions >= 1.4.0 nan
    values are sorted to the end. The extended sort order is:

      * Real: [R, nan]
      * Complex: [R + Rj, R + nanj, nan + Rj, nan + nanj]

    where R is a non-nan real value. Complex values with the same nan
    placements are sorted according to the non-nan part if it exists.
    Non-nan values are sorted as before.

    .. versionadded:: 1.12.0

    quicksort has been changed to:
    `introsort <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introsort>`_.
    When sorting does not make enough progress it switches to
    `heapsort <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort>`_.
    This implementation makes quicksort O(n*log(n)) in the worst case.

    'stable' automatically chooses the best stable sorting algorithm
    for the data type being sorted.
    It, along with 'mergesort' is currently mapped to
    `timsort <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort>`_
    or `radix sort <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort>`_
    depending on the data type.
    API forward compatibility currently limits the
    ability to select the implementation and it is hardwired for the different
    data types.

    .. versionadded:: 1.17.0

    Timsort is added for better performance on already or nearly
    sorted data. On random data timsort is almost identical to
    mergesort. It is now used for stable sort while quicksort is still the
    default sort if none is chosen. For timsort details, refer to
    `CPython listsort.txt
    <https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.7/Objects/listsort.txt>`_
    'mergesort' and 'stable' are mapped to radix sort for integer data types.
    Radix sort is an O(n) sort instead of O(n log n).

    .. versionchanged:: 1.18.0

    NaT now sorts to the end of arrays for consistency with NaN.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1,4],[3,1]])
    >>> np.sort(a)                # sort along the last axis
    array([[1, 4],
           [1, 3]])
    >>> np.sort(a, axis=None)     # sort the flattened array
    array([1, 1, 3, 4])
    >>> np.sort(a, axis=0)        # sort along the first axis
    array([[1, 1],
           [3, 4]])

    Use the `order` keyword to specify a field to use when sorting a
    structured array:

    >>> dtype = [('name', 'S10'), ('height', float), ('age', int)]
    >>> values = [('Arthur', 1.8, 41), ('Lancelot', 1.9, 38),

    Notes
    -----
    When the total size of the array does not change `~numpy.reshape` should

    Warning: This functionality does **not** consider axes separately,
    i.e. it does not apply interpolation/extrapolation.
    It fills the return array with the required number of elements, iterating
    over `a` in C-order, disregarding axes (and cycling back from the start if
    the new shape is larger).  This functionality is therefore not suitable to
    resize images, or data where each axis represents a separate and distinct

    Return specified diagonals.

    If `a` is 2-D, returns the diagonal of `a` with the given offset,
    i.e., the collection of elements of the form ``a[i, i+offset]``.  If
    `a` has more than two dimensions, then the axes specified by `axis1`
    and `axis2` are used to determine the 2-D sub-array whose diagonal is
    returned.  The shape of the resulting array can be determined by
    removing `axis1` and `axis2` and appending an index to the right equal
    to the size of the resulting diagonals.

    In versions of NumPy prior to 1.7, this function always returned a new,
    independent array containing a copy of the values in the diagonal.

    In NumPy 1.7 and 1.8, it continues to return a copy of the diagonal,
    but depending on this fact is deprecated. Writing to the resulting
    array continues to work as it used to, but a FutureWarning is issued.

    Starting in NumPy 1.9 it returns a read-only view on the original array.
    Attempting to write to the resulting array will produce an error.

    In some future release, it will return a read/write view and writing to
    the returned array will alter your original array.  The returned array
    will have the same type as the input array.

    If you don't write to the array returned by this function, then you can
    just ignore all of the above.

    If you depend on the current behavior, then we suggest copying the
    returned array explicitly, i.e., use ``np.diagonal(a).copy()`` instead
    of just ``np.diagonal(a)``. This will work with both past and future
    versions of NumPy.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Array from which the diagonals are taken.
    offset : int, optional
        Offset of the diagonal from the main diagonal.  Can be positive or
        negative.  Defaults to main diagonal (0).
    axis1 : int, optional
        Axis to be used as the first axis of the 2-D sub-arrays from which
        the diagonals should be taken.  Defaults to first axis (0).
    axis2 : int, optional
        Axis to be used as the second axis of the 2-D sub-arrays from
        which the diagonals should be taken. Defaults to second axis (1).

    Returns
    -------
    array_of_diagonals : ndarray
        If `a` is 2-D, then a 1-D array containing the diagonal and of the
        same type as `a` is returned unless `a` is a `matrix`, in which case
        a 1-D array rather than a (2-D) `matrix` is returned in order to
        maintain backward compatibility.

        If ``a.ndim > 2``, then the dimensions specified by `axis1` and `axis2`
        are removed, and a new axis inserted at the end corresponding to the
        diagonal.

    The sub-arrays whose main diagonals we just obtained; note that each
    corresponds to fixing the right-most (column) axis, and that the

    axis1, axis2 : int, optional

        from which the diagonals should be taken. Defaults are the first two
        axes of `a`.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        Determines the data-type of the returned array and of the accumulator
        where the elements are summed. If dtype has the value None and `a` is
        of integer type of precision less than the default integer
        precision, then the default integer precision is used. Otherwise,
        the precision is the same as that of `a`.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Array into which the output is placed. Its type is preserved and
        it must be of the right shape to hold the output.

    Returns
    -------
    sum_along_diagonals : ndarray
        If `a` is 2-D, the sum along the diagonal is returned.  If `a` has
        larger dimensions, then an array of sums along diagonals is returned.

    """Return a contiguous flattened array.

    A 1-D array, containing the elements of the input, is returned.  A copy is
    made only if needed.

    As of NumPy 1.10, the returned array will have the same type as the input
    array. (for example, a masked array will be returned for a masked array
    input)

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.  The elements in `a` are read in the order specified by
        `order`, and packed as a 1-D array.
    order : {'C','F', 'A', 'K'}, optional

        The elements of `a` are read using this index order. 'C' means
        to index the elements in row-major, C-style order,
        with the last axis index changing fastest, back to the first
        axis index changing slowest.  'F' means to index the elements
        in column-major, Fortran-style order, with the
        first index changing fastest, and the last index changing
        slowest. Note that the 'C' and 'F' options take no account of
        the memory layout of the underlying array, and only refer to
        the order of axis indexing.  'A' means to read the elements in
        Fortran-like index order if `a` is Fortran *contiguous* in
        memory, C-like order otherwise.  'K' means to read the
        elements in the order they occur in memory, except for
        reversing the data when strides are negative.  By default, 'C'
        index order is used.

    Returns
    -------
    y : array_like
        y is a contiguous 1-D array of the same subtype as `a`,
        with shape ``(a.size,)``.
        Note that matrices are special cased for backward compatibility,
        if `a` is a matrix, then y is a 1-D ndarray.

    See Also
    --------
    ndarray.flat : 1-D iterator over an array.
    ndarray.flatten : 1-D array copy of the elements of an array
                      in row-major order.
    ndarray.reshape : Change the shape of an array without changing its data.

    Notes
    -----
    In row-major, C-style order, in two dimensions, the row index
    varies the slowest, and the column index the quickest.  This can
    be generalized to multiple dimensions, where row-major order
    implies that the index along the first axis varies slowest, and
    the index along the last quickest.  The opposite holds for
    column-major, Fortran-style index ordering.

    When a view is desired in as many cases as possible, ``arr.reshape(-1)``
    may be preferable. However, ``ravel`` supports ``K`` in the optional
    ``order`` argument while ``reshape`` does not.

    Examples
    --------
    It is equivalent to ``reshape(-1, order=order)``.

    >>> x = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
    >>> np.ravel(x)
    array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])

    >>> x.reshape(-1)
    array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])

    >>> np.ravel(x, order='F')
    array([1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6])

    When ``order`` is 'A', it will preserve the array's 'C' or 'F' ordering:

    >>> np.ravel(x.T)
    array([1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6])
    >>> np.ravel(x.T, order='A')
    array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])

    When ``order`` is 'K', it will preserve orderings that are neither 'C'
    nor 'F', but won't reverse axes:

    >>> a = np.arange(3)[::-1]; a
    array([2, 1, 0])
    >>> a.ravel(order='C')
    array([2, 1, 0])
    >>> a.ravel(order='K')

    Return the indices of the elements that are non-zero.

    Returns a tuple of arrays, one for each dimension of `a`,
    containing the indices of the non-zero elements in that
    dimension. The values in `a` are always tested and returned in
    row-major, C-style order.

    To group the indices by element, rather than dimension, use `argwhere`,
    which returns a row for each non-zero element.

    .. note::

       When called on a zero-d array or scalar, ``nonzero(a)`` is treated
       as ``nonzero(atleast_1d(a))``.

       .. deprecated:: 1.17.0

          Use `atleast_1d` explicitly if this behavior is deliberate.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like

        array.
    ndarray.nonzero :
        Equivalent ndarray method.
    count_nonzero :
        Counts the number of non-zero elements in the input array.

    Notes
    -----
    While the nonzero values can be obtained with ``a[nonzero(a)]``, it is
    recommended to use ``x[x.astype(bool)]`` or ``x[x != 0]`` instead, which
    will correctly handle 0-d arrays.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array([[3, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0], [5, 6, 0]])
    >>> x
    array([[3, 0, 0],
           [0, 4, 0],
           [5, 6, 0]])
    >>> np.nonzero(x)
    (array([0, 1, 2, 2]), array([0, 1, 0, 1]))

    >>> x[np.nonzero(x)]
    array([3, 4, 5, 6])
    >>> np.transpose(np.nonzero(x))
    array([[0, 0],
           [1, 1],
           [2, 0],
           [2, 1]])

    A common use for ``nonzero`` is to find the indices of an array, where
    a condition is True.  Given an array `a`, the condition `a` > 3 is a
    boolean array and since False is interpreted as 0, np.nonzero(a > 3)
    yields the indices of the `a` where the condition is true.

    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
    >>> a > 3
    array([[False, False, False],
           [ True,  True,  True],
           [ True,  True,  True]])
    >>> np.nonzero(a > 3)
    (array([1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]), array([0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]))

    Using this result to index `a` is equivalent to using the mask directly:

    >>> a[np.nonzero(a > 3)]
    array([4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
    >>> a[a > 3]  # prefer this spelling
    array([4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])

    ``nonzero`` can also be called as a method of the array.

    >>> (a > 3).nonzero()
    (array([1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]), array([0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]))

    mean, average

    Notes
    -----
    Arithmetic is modular when using integer types, and no error is
    raised on overflow.

    The sum of an empty array is the neutral element 0:

    >>> np.sum([])
    0.0

    For floating point numbers the numerical precision of sum (and
    ``np.add.reduce``) is in general limited by directly adding each number
    individually to the result causing rounding errors in every step.
    However, often numpy will use a  numerically better approach (partial
    pairwise summation) leading to improved precision in many use-cases.
    This improved precision is always provided when no ``axis`` is given.
    When ``axis`` is given, it will depend on which axis is summed.
    Technically, to provide the best speed possible, the improved precision
    is only used when the summation is along the fast axis in memory.
    Note that the exact precision may vary depending on other parameters.
    In contrast to NumPy, Python's ``math.fsum`` function uses a slower but
    more precise approach to summation.
    Especially when summing a large number of lower precision floating point
    numbers, such as ``float32``, numerical errors can become significant.
    In such cases it can be advisable to use `dtype="float64"` to use a higher
    precision for the output.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.sum([0.5, 1.5])
    2.0
    >>> np.sum([0.5, 0.7, 0.2, 1.5], dtype=np.int32)
    1
    >>> np.sum([[0, 1], [0, 5]])
    6
    >>> np.sum([[0, 1], [0, 5]], axis=0)
    array([0, 6])
    >>> np.sum([[0, 1], [0, 5]], axis=1)
    array([1, 5])
    >>> np.sum([[0, 1], [np.nan, 5]], where=[False, True], axis=1)
    array([1., 5.])

    If the accumulator is too small, overflow occurs:

    >>> np.ones(128, dtype=np.int8).sum(dtype=np.int8)
    -128

    You can also start the sum with a value other than zero:

    Test whether any array element along a given axis evaluates to True.

    Returns single boolean if `axis` is ``None``

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array or object that can be converted to an array.
    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
        Axis or axes along which a logical OR reduction is performed.
        The default (``axis=None``) is to perform a logical OR over all
        the dimensions of the input array. `axis` may be negative, in
        which case it counts from the last to the first axis.

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

        If this is a tuple of ints, a reduction is performed on multiple
        axes, instead of a single axis or all the axes as before.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternate output array in which to place the result.  It must have
        the same shape as the expected output and its type is preserved
        (e.g., if it is of type float, then it will remain so, returning
        1.0 for True and 0.0 for False, regardless of the type of `a`).
        See :ref:`ufuncs-output-type` for more details.

    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the input array.

        If the default value is passed, then `keepdims` will not be
        passed through to the `any` method of sub-classes of
        `ndarray`, however any non-default value will be.  If the
        sub-class' method does not implement `keepdims` any
        exceptions will be raised.

    where : array_like of bool, optional
        Elements to include in checking for any `True` values.

    Returns
    -------
    any : bool or ndarray
        A new boolean or `ndarray` is returned unless `out` is specified,
        in which case a reference to `out` is returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like

    Notes
    -----
    NaN values are propagated, that is if at least one item is NaN, the
    corresponding max value will be NaN as well. To ignore NaN values
    (MATLAB behavior), please use nanmax.

    Don't use `~numpy.max` for element-wise comparison of 2 arrays; when
    ``a.shape[0]`` is 2, ``maximum(a[0], a[1])`` is faster than
    ``max(a, axis=0)``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.arange(4).reshape((2,2))
    >>> a

    argmin :
        Return the indices of the minimum values.

    nanmax, maximum, fmax

    Notes
    -----
    NaN values are propagated, that is if at least one item is NaN, the
    corresponding min value will be NaN as well. To ignore NaN values
    (MATLAB behavior), please use nanmin.

    Don't use `~numpy.min` for element-wise comparison of 2 arrays; when
    ``a.shape[0]`` is 2, ``minimum(a[0], a[1])`` is faster than
    ``min(a, axis=0)``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.arange(4).reshape((2,2))
    >>> a
    array([[0, 1],
           [2, 3]])
    >>> np.min(a)           # Minimum of the flattened array
    0
    >>> np.min(a, axis=0)   # Minima along the first axis
    array([0, 1])
    >>> np.min(a, axis=1)   # Minima along the second axis
    array([0, 2])
    >>> np.min(a, where=[False, True], initial=10, axis=0)
    array([10,  1])

    >>> b = np.arange(5, dtype=float)
    >>> b[2] = np.nan
    >>> np.min(b)
    np.float64(nan)
    >>> np.min(b, where=~np.isnan(b), initial=10)
    0.0
    >>> np.nanmin(b)
    0.0

    >>> np.min([[-50], [10]], axis=-1, initial=0)
    array([-50,   0])

    Notice that the initial value is used as one of the elements for which the
    minimum is determined, unlike for the default argument Python's max
    function, which is only used for empty iterables.

    Notice that this isn't the same as Python's ``default`` argument.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input data.
    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
        Axis or axes along which a product is performed.  The default,
        axis=None, will calculate the product of all the elements in the
        input array. If axis is negative it counts from the last to the
        first axis.

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

        If axis is a tuple of ints, a product is performed on all of the
        axes specified in the tuple instead of a single axis or all the
        axes as before.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        The type of the returned array, as well as of the accumulator in
        which the elements are multiplied.  The dtype of `a` is used by
        default unless `a` has an integer dtype of less precision than the
        default platform integer.  In that case, if `a` is signed then the
        platform integer is used while if `a` is unsigned then an unsigned
        integer of the same precision as the platform integer is used.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must have
        the same shape as the expected output, but the type of the output
        values will be cast if necessary.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left in the
        result as dimensions with size one. With this option, the result
        will broadcast correctly against the input array.

        If the default value is passed, then `keepdims` will not be
        passed through to the `prod` method of sub-classes of
        `ndarray`, however any non-default value will be.  If the
        sub-class' method does not implement `keepdims` any
        exceptions will be raised.
    initial : scalar, optional
        The starting value for this product. See `~numpy.ufunc.reduce`
        for details.

        .. versionadded:: 1.15.0

    where : array_like of bool, optional
        Elements to include in the product. See `~numpy.ufunc.reduce`
        for details.

        .. versionadded:: 1.17.0

    Returns
    -------
    product_along_axis : ndarray, see `dtype` parameter above.
        An array shaped as `a` but with the specified axis removed.
        Returns a reference to `out` if specified.

    Notes
    -----
    Arithmetic is modular when using integer types, and no error is
    raised on overflow.  That means that, on a 32-bit platform:

    >>> x = np.array([536870910, 536870910, 536870910, 536870910])
    >>> np.prod(x)
    16 # may vary

    The product of an empty array is the neutral element 1:

    >>> np.prod([])
    1.0

    Examples
    --------
    By default, calculate the product of all elements:

    >>> np.prod([1.,2.])
    2.0

    Even when the input array is two-dimensional:

    >>> a = np.array([[1., 2.], [3., 4.]])
    >>> np.prod(a)
    24.0

    But we can also specify the axis over which to multiply:

    >>> np.prod(a, axis=1)
    array([  2.,  12.])
    >>> np.prod(a, axis=0)
    array([3., 8.])

    Or select specific elements to include:

    >>> np.prod([1., np.nan, 3.], where=[True, False, True])
    3.0

    If the type of `x` is unsigned, then the output type is
    the unsigned platform integer:

    >>> x = np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype=np.uint8)
    >>> np.prod(x).dtype == np.uint
    True

    If `x` is of a signed integer type, then the output type
    is the default platform integer:

    >>> x = np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype=np.int8)
    >>> np.prod(x).dtype == int
    True

    You can also start the product with a value other than one:

    -------

        An array of the same type as `a`, containing the rounded values.
        Unless `out` was specified, a new array is created.  A reference to
        the result is returned.

        The real and imaginary parts of complex numbers are rounded

    See Also
    --------
    ndarray.round : equivalent method
    around : an alias for this function
    ceil, fix, floor, rint, trunc


    Notes
    -----
    For values exactly halfway between rounded decimal values, NumPy
    rounds to the nearest even value. Thus 1.5 and 2.5 round to 2.0,
    -0.5 and 0.5 round to 0.0, etc.

    ``np.round`` uses a fast but sometimes inexact algorithm to round
    floating-point datatypes. For positive `decimals` it is equivalent to
    ``np.true_divide(np.rint(a * 10**decimals), 10**decimals)``, which has
    error due to the inexact representation of decimal fractions in the IEEE
    floating point standard [1]_ and errors introduced when scaling by powers
    of ten. For instance, note the extra "1" in the following:

        >>> np.round(56294995342131.5, 3)
        56294995342131.51

    If your goal is to print such values with a fixed number of decimals, it is
    preferable to use numpy's float printing routines to limit the number of
    printed decimals:

        >>> np.format_float_positional(56294995342131.5, precision=3)
        '56294995342131.5'

    The float printing routines use an accurate but much more computationally
    demanding algorithm to compute the number of digits after the decimal
    point.

    Alternatively, Python's builtin `round` function uses a more accurate
    but slower algorithm for 64-bit floating point values:

        >>> round(56294995342131.5, 3)
        56294995342131.5
        >>> np.round(16.055, 2), round(16.055, 2)  # equals 16.0549999999999997

    Notes
    -----
    The arithmetic mean is the sum of the elements along the axis divided
    by the number of elements.

    Note that for floating-point input, the mean is computed using the
    same precision the input has.  Depending on the input data, this can
    cause the results to be inaccurate, especially for `float32` (see
    example below).  Specifying a higher-precision accumulator using the
    `dtype` keyword can alleviate this issue.

    By default, `float16` results are computed using `float32` intermediates
    for extra precision.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    >>> np.mean(a)
    2.5
    >>> np.mean(a, axis=0)
    array([2., 3.])
    >>> np.mean(a, axis=1)
    array([1.5, 3.5])

    In single precision, `mean` can be inaccurate:

    >>> a = np.zeros((2, 512*512), dtype=np.float32)
    >>> a[0, :] = 1.0
    >>> a[1, :] = 0.1
    >>> np.mean(a)
    0.54999924

    Computing the mean in float64 is more accurate:

    >>> np.mean(a, dtype=np.float64)
    0.55000000074505806 # may vary

    Specifying a where argument:

        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must have
        the same shape as the expected output but the type (of the calculated
        values) will be cast if necessary.
        See :ref:`ufuncs-output-type` for more details.
    ddof : {int, float}, optional
        Means Delta Degrees of Freedom.  The divisor used in calculations
        is ``N - ddof``, where ``N`` represents the number of elements.
        By default `ddof` is zero. See Notes for details about use of `ddof`.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the input array.

        If the default value is passed, then `keepdims` will not be
        passed through to the `std` method of sub-classes of
        `ndarray`, however any non-default value will be.  If the
        sub-class' method does not implement `keepdims` any
        exceptions will be raised.
    where : array_like of bool, optional
        Elements to include in the standard deviation.

        .. versionadded:: 1.20.0

    mean : array_like, optional
        Provide the mean to prevent its recalculation. The mean should have
        a shape as if it was calculated with ``keepdims=True``.
        The axis for the calculation of the mean should be the same as used in
        the call to this std function.

        Array API compatible name for the ``ddof`` parameter. Only one of them
        can be provided at the same time.

        .. versionadded:: 2.0.0

    Returns
    -------
    standard_deviation : ndarray, see dtype parameter above.
        If `out` is None, return a new array containing the standard deviation,
        otherwise return a reference to the output array.

    --------
    var, mean, nanmean, nanstd, nanvar
    :ref:`ufuncs-output-type`

    Notes
    -----
    There are several common variants of the array standard deviation
    calculation. Assuming the input `a` is a one-dimensional NumPy array
    and ``mean`` is either provided as an argument or computed as
    ``a.mean()``, NumPy computes the standard deviation of an array as::

        N = len(a)
        d2 = abs(a - mean)**2  # abs is for complex `a`
        var = d2.sum() / (N - ddof)  # note use of `ddof`
        std = var**0.5

    Different values of the argument `ddof` are useful in different
    contexts. NumPy's default ``ddof=0`` corresponds with the expression:

    .. math::

        \sqrt{\frac{\sum_i{|a_i - \bar{a}|^2 }}{N}}

    which is sometimes called the "population standard deviation" in the field
    of statistics because it applies the definition of standard deviation to
    `a` as if `a` were a complete population of possible observations.

    Many other libraries define the standard deviation of an array
    differently, e.g.:

    .. math::

        \sqrt{\frac{\sum_i{|a_i - \bar{a}|^2 }}{N - 1}}

    In statistics, the resulting quantity is sometimed called the "sample
    standard deviation" because if `a` is a random sample from a larger
    population, this calculation provides the square root of an unbiased
    estimate of the variance of the population. The use of :math:`N-1` in the
    denominator is often called "Bessel's correction" because it corrects for
    bias (toward lower values) in the variance estimate introduced when the
    sample mean of `a` is used in place of the true mean of the population.
    The resulting estimate of the standard deviation is still biased, but less
    than it would have been without the correction. For this quantity, use
    ``ddof=1``.

    Note that, for complex numbers, `std` takes the absolute
    value before squaring, so that the result is always real and nonnegative.

    For floating-point input, the standard deviation is computed using the same
    precision the input has. Depending on the input data, this can cause
    the results to be inaccurate, especially for float32 (see example below).
    Specifying a higher-accuracy accumulator using the `dtype` keyword can
    alleviate this issue.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    >>> np.std(a)
    1.1180339887498949 # may vary
    >>> np.std(a, axis=0)
    array([1.,  1.])
    >>> np.std(a, axis=1)
    array([0.5,  0.5])

    In single precision, std() can be inaccurate:

    >>> a = np.zeros((2, 512*512), dtype=np.float32)
    >>> a[0, :] = 1.0
    >>> a[1, :] = 0.1
    >>> np.std(a)
    0.45000005

    Computing the standard deviation in float64 is more accurate:

    >>> np.std(a, dtype=np.float64)
    0.44999999925494177 # may vary

    Specifying a where argument:

    >>> a = np.array([[14, 8, 11, 10], [7, 9, 10, 11], [10, 15, 5, 10]])
    >>> np.std(a)
    2.614064523559687 # may vary
    >>> np.std(a, where=[[True], [True], [False]])
    2.0

    Using the mean keyword to save computation time:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from timeit import timeit
    >>> a = np.array([[14, 8, 11, 10], [7, 9, 10, 11], [10, 15, 5, 10]])
    >>> mean = np.mean(a, axis=1, keepdims=True)
    >>>
    >>> g = globals()
    >>> n = 10000
    >>> t1 = timeit("std = np.std(a, axis=1, mean=mean)", globals=g, number=n)
    >>> t2 = timeit("std = np.std(a, axis=1)", globals=g, number=n)
    >>> print(f'Percentage execution time saved {100*(t2-t1)/t2:.0f}%')

    Compute the variance along the specified axis.

    Returns the variance of the array elements, a measure of the spread of a

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Array containing numbers whose variance is desired.  If `a` is not an
        array, a conversion is attempted.

        If this is a tuple of ints, a variance is performed over multiple axes,
        instead of a single axis or all the axes as before.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        Type to use in computing the variance.  For arrays of integer type
        the default is `float64`; for arrays of float types it is the same as
        the array type.
    out : ndarray, optional
