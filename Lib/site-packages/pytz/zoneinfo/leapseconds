# periodically uses leap seconds to keep UTC to within 0.9 s of UT1
# (a proxy for Earth's angle in space as measured by astronomers)

# There were no leap seconds before 1972, as no official mechanism
# accounted for the discrepancy between atomic time (TAI) and the earth's
# rotation.  The first ("1 Jan 1972") data line in leap-seconds.list
# does not denote a leap second; it denotes the start of the current definition
# of UTC.

# All leap-seconds are Stationary (S) at the given UTC time.
# The correction (+ or -) is made at the given time, so in the unlikely
# event of a negative leap second, a line would look like this:
# Leap	YEAR	MON	DAY	23:59:59	-	S
# Typical lines look like this:
# Leap	YEAR	MON	DAY	23:59:60	+	S
