Keras: Theano-based Deep Learning library
==================================
Keras is a minimalist, highly modular neural network library in 
the spirit of Torch, written in Python / Theano so as not to have 
to deal with the dearth of ecosystem in Lua. It was developed with 
a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from 
idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing 
good research.
