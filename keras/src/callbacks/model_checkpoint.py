class ModelCheckpoint(MonitorCallback):
    """Callback to save the Keras model or model weights at some frequency.

    `ModelCheckpoint` callback is used in conjunction with training using
    `model.fit()` to save a model or weights (in a checkpoint file) at some
    interval, so the model or weights can be loaded later to continue the
    training from the state saved.

    A few options this callback provides include:

    - Whether to only keep the model that has achieved the "best performance" so
      far, or whether to save the model at the end of every epoch regardless of
      performance.
    - Definition of "best"; which quantity to monitor and whether it should be
      maximized or minimized.
    - The frequency it should save at. Currently, the callback supports saving
      at the end of every epoch, or after a fixed number of training batches.
    - Whether only weights are saved, or the whole model is saved.

    Example:

    ```python
    model.compile(loss=..., optimizer=...,
                  metrics=['accuracy'])

    EPOCHS = 10
    checkpoint_filepath = '/tmp/ckpt/checkpoint.model.keras'
    model_checkpoint_callback = keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(
        filepath=checkpoint_filepath,
        monitor='val_accuracy',
        mode='max',
        save_best_only=True)

    # Model is saved at the end of every epoch, if it's the best seen so far.
    model.fit(epochs=EPOCHS, callbacks=[model_checkpoint_callback])

    # The model (that are considered the best) can be loaded as -
    keras.models.load_model(checkpoint_filepath)

    # Alternatively, one could checkpoint just the model weights as -
    checkpoint_filepath = '/tmp/ckpt/checkpoint.weights.h5'
    model_checkpoint_callback = keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(
        filepath=checkpoint_filepath,
        save_weights_only=True,
        monitor='val_accuracy',
        mode='max',
        save_best_only=True)

    # Model weights are saved at the end of every epoch, if it's the best seen
    # so far.
    model.fit(epochs=EPOCHS, callbacks=[model_checkpoint_callback])

    # The model weights (that are considered the best) can be loaded as -
    model.load_weights(checkpoint_filepath)
    ```

    Args:
        filepath: string or `PathLike`, path to save the model file.
            `filepath` can contain named formatting options,
            which will be filled the value of `epoch` and keys in `logs`
            (passed in `on_epoch_end`).
            The `filepath` name needs to end with `".weights.h5"` when
            `save_weights_only=True` or should end with `".keras"` or `".h5"`
            when checkpoint saving the whole model (default).
            For example:
            if `filepath` is `"{epoch:02d}-{val_loss:.2f}.keras"` or
            "{epoch:02d}-{val_loss:.2f}.weights.h5"`, then the model
            checkpoints will be saved with the epoch number and the validation
            loss in the filename. The directory of the filepath
            should not be reused by any other callbacks to avoid conflicts.
        monitor: The metric name to monitor. Typically the metrics are set by
            the `Model.compile` method. Note:
            * Prefix the name with `"val_"` to monitor validation metrics.
            * Use `"loss"` or `"val_loss"` to monitor the model's total loss.
            * If you specify metrics as strings, like `"accuracy"`, pass the
                same string (with or without the `"val_"` prefix).
            * If you pass `metrics.Metric` objects, `monitor` should be set to
                `metric.name`
            * If you're not sure about the metric names you can check the
                contents of the `history.history` dictionary returned by
                `history = model.fit()`
            * Multi-output models set additional prefixes on the metric names.
        verbose: Verbosity mode, 0 or 1. Mode 0 is silent, and mode 1
            displays messages when the callback takes an action.
        save_best_only: if `save_best_only=True`, it only saves when the model
            is considered the "best" and the latest best model according to the
            quantity monitored will not be overwritten. If `filepath` doesn't
            contain formatting options like `{epoch}` then `filepath` will be
            overwritten by each new better model.
        mode: one of {`"auto"`, `"min"`, `"max"`}. If `save_best_only=True`, the
            decision to overwrite the current save file is made based on either
            the maximization or the minimization of the monitored quantity.
            For `val_acc`, this should be `"max"`, for `val_loss` this should be
            `"min"`, etc. In `"auto"` mode, the direction is automatically
            inferred from the name of the monitored quantity.
        save_weights_only: if `True`, then only the model's weights will be
            saved (`model.save_weights(filepath)`), else the full model is
            saved (`model.save(filepath)`).
        save_freq: `"epoch"` or integer. When using `"epoch"`, the callback
            saves the model after each epoch. When using integer, the callback
            saves the model at end of this many batches. If the `Model` is
            compiled with `steps_per_execution=N`, then the saving criteria will
            be checked every Nth batch. Note that if the saving isn't aligned to
            epochs, the monitored metric may potentially be less reliable (it
            could reflect as little as 1 batch, since the metrics get reset
            every epoch). Defaults to `"epoch"`.
        initial_value_threshold: Floating point initial "best" value of the
            metric to be monitored. Only applies if `save_best_value=True`. Only
            overwrites the model weights already saved if the performance of
            current model is better than this value.
