        Example:

        ```python
        model.compile(
            optimizer=keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=1e-3),
            loss=keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy(),

                keras.metrics.FalseNegatives(),
            ],
        )
        ```

        Args:
            optimizer: String (name of optimizer) or optimizer instance. See
                `keras.optimizers`.
            loss: Loss function. May be a string (name of loss function), or
                a `keras.losses.Loss` instance. See `keras.losses`. A
                loss function is any callable with the signature
                `loss = fn(y_true, y_pred)`, where `y_true` are the ground truth
                values, and `y_pred` are the model's predictions.
                `y_true` should have shape `(batch_size, d0, .. dN)`
                (except in the case of sparse loss functions such as
                sparse categorical crossentropy which expects integer arrays of
                shape `(batch_size, d0, .. dN-1)`).
                `y_pred` should have shape `(batch_size, d0, .. dN)`.
                The loss function should return a float tensor.
            loss_weights: Optional list or dictionary specifying scalar
                coefficients (Python floats) to weight the loss contributions of
                different model outputs. The loss value that will be minimized
                by the model will then be the *weighted sum* of all individual
                losses, weighted by the `loss_weights` coefficients.  If a list,
                it is expected to have a 1:1 mapping to the model's outputs. If
                a dict, it is expected to map output names (strings) to scalar
                coefficients.
            metrics: List of metrics to be evaluated by the model during
                training and testing. Each of this can be a string (name of a
                built-in function), function or a `keras.metrics.Metric`
                instance. See `keras.metrics`. Typically you will use
                `metrics=['accuracy']`. A function is any callable with the
                signature `result = fn(y_true, _pred)`. To specify different
                metrics for different outputs of a multi-output model, you could
                also pass a dictionary, such as
                `metrics={'a':'accuracy', 'b':['accuracy', 'mse']}`.
                You can also pass a list to specify a metric or a list of
                metrics for each output, such as
                `metrics=[['accuracy'], ['accuracy', 'mse']]`
                or `metrics=['accuracy', ['accuracy', 'mse']]`. When you pass
                the strings 'accuracy' or 'acc', we convert this to one of
                `keras.metrics.BinaryAccuracy`,
                `keras.metrics.CategoricalAccuracy`,
                `keras.metrics.SparseCategoricalAccuracy` based on the
                shapes of the targets and of the model output. A similar
                conversion is done for the strings `"crossentropy"`
                and `"ce"` as well.
                The metrics passed here are evaluated without sample weighting;
                if you would like sample weighting to apply, you can specify
                your metrics via the `weighted_metrics` argument instead.
            weighted_metrics: List of metrics to be evaluated and weighted by
                `sample_weight` or `class_weight` during training and testing.
            run_eagerly: Bool. If `True`, this model's forward pass
                 will never be compiled. It is recommended to leave this
                 as `False` when training (for best performance),
                 and to set it to `True` when debugging.
            steps_per_execution: Int. The number of batches to run
                during each a single compiled function call. Running multiple
                batches inside a single compiled function call can
                greatly improve performance on TPUs or small models with a large
                Python overhead. At most, one full epoch will be run each
                execution. If a number larger than the size of the epoch is
                passed, the execution will be truncated to the size of the
                epoch. Note that if `steps_per_execution` is set to `N`,
                `Callback.on_batch_begin` and `Callback.on_batch_end` methods
                will only be called every `N` batches (i.e. before/after
                each compiled function execution).
                Not supported with the PyTorch backend.
            jit_compile: Bool or `"auto"`. Whether to use XLA compilation when
                compiling a model. For `jax` and `tensorflow` backends,
                `jit_compile="auto"` enables XLA compilation if the model
                supports it, and disabled otherwise.
                For `torch` backend, `"auto"` will default to eager
                execution and `jit_compile=True` will run with `torch.compile`
                with the `"inductor"` backend.
            auto_scale_loss: Bool. If `True` and the model dtype policy is
                `"mixed_float16"`, the passed optimizer will be automatically
                wrapped in a `LossScaleOptimizer`, which will dynamically
                scale the loss to prevent underflow.

        Args:
            x: Input data. It could be:
                - A NumPy array (or array-like), or a list of arrays
                (in case the model has multiple inputs).
                - A tensor, or a list of tensors
                (in case the model has multiple inputs).
                - A dict mapping input names to the corresponding array/tensors,
                if the model has named inputs.
                - A `tf.data.Dataset`. Should return a tuple
                of either `(inputs, targets)` or
                `(inputs, targets, sample_weights)`.
                - A `keras.utils.PyDataset` returning `(inputs,
                targets)` or `(inputs, targets, sample_weights)`.
            y: Target data. Like the input data `x`,
                it could be either NumPy array(s) or backend-native tensor(s).
                If `x` is a dataset, generator,
                or `keras.utils.PyDataset` instance, `y` should
                not be specified (since targets will be obtained from `x`).
            batch_size: Integer or `None`.
                Number of samples per gradient update.
                If unspecified, `batch_size` will default to 32.
                Do not specify the `batch_size` if your data is in the
                form of datasets, generators, or `keras.utils.PyDataset`
                instances (since they generate batches).
            epochs: Integer. Number of epochs to train the model.
                An epoch is an iteration over the entire `x` and `y`
                data provided
                (unless the `steps_per_epoch` flag is set to
                something other than None).
                Note that in conjunction with `initial_epoch`,
                `epochs` is to be understood as "final epoch".
                The model is not trained for a number of iterations
                given by `epochs`, but merely until the epoch
                of index `epochs` is reached.
            verbose: `"auto"`, 0, 1, or 2. Verbosity mode.
                0 = silent, 1 = progress bar, 2 = one line per epoch.
                "auto" becomes 1 for most cases.
                Note that the progress bar is not
                particularly useful when logged to a file,
                so `verbose=2` is recommended when not running interactively
                (e.g., in a production environment). Defaults to `"auto"`.
            callbacks: List of `keras.callbacks.Callback` instances.
                List of callbacks to apply during training.
                See `keras.callbacks`. Note
                `keras.callbacks.ProgbarLogger` and
                `keras.callbacks.History` callbacks are created
                automatically and need not be passed to `model.fit()`.
                `keras.callbacks.ProgbarLogger` is created
                or not based on the `verbose` argument in `model.fit()`.
            validation_split: Float between 0 and 1.
                Fraction of the training data to be used as validation data.
                The model will set apart this fraction of the training data,
                will not train on it, and will evaluate
                the loss and any model metrics
                on this data at the end of each epoch.
                The validation data is selected from the last samples
                in the `x` and `y` data provided, before shuffling. This
                argument is not supported when `x` is a dataset, generator or
                `keras.utils.PyDataset` instance.
                If both `validation_data` and `validation_split` are provided,
                `validation_data` will override `validation_split`.
            validation_data: Data on which to evaluate
                the loss and any model metrics at the end of each epoch.
                The model will not be trained on this data. Thus, note the fact
                that the validation loss of data provided using
                `validation_split` or `validation_data` is not affected by
                regularization layers like noise and dropout.
                `validation_data` will override `validation_split`.
                It could be:
                - A tuple `(x_val, y_val)` of NumPy arrays or tensors.
                - A tuple `(x_val, y_val, val_sample_weights)` of NumPy
                arrays.
                - A `tf.data.Dataset`.
                - A Python generator or `keras.utils.PyDataset` returning
                `(inputs, targets)` or `(inputs, targets, sample_weights)`.
            shuffle: Boolean, whether to shuffle the training data
                before each epoch. This argument is
                ignored when `x` is a generator or a `tf.data.Dataset`.
            class_weight: Optional dictionary mapping class indices (integers)
                to a weight (float) value, used for weighting the loss function
                (during training only).
                This can be useful to tell the model to
                "pay more attention" to samples from
                an under-represented class. When `class_weight` is specified
                and targets have a rank of 2 or greater, either `y` must be
                one-hot encoded, or an explicit final dimension of `1` must
                be included for sparse class labels.
            sample_weight: Optional NumPy array of weights for
                the training samples, used for weighting the loss function
                (during training only). You can either pass a flat (1D)
                NumPy array with the same length as the input samples
                (1:1 mapping between weights and samples),
                or in the case of temporal data,
                you can pass a 2D array with shape
                `(samples, sequence_length)`,
                to apply a different weight to every timestep of every sample.
                This argument is not supported when `x` is a dataset, generator,
                or `keras.utils.PyDataset` instance, instead provide the
                sample_weights as the third element of `x`.
                Note that sample weighting does not apply to metrics specified
                via the `metrics` argument in `compile()`. To apply sample
                weighting to your metrics, you can specify them via the
                `weighted_metrics` in `compile()` instead.
            initial_epoch: Integer.
                Epoch at which to start training
                (useful for resuming a previous training run).
            steps_per_epoch: Integer or `None`.
                Total number of steps (batches of samples)
                before declaring one epoch finished and starting the
                next epoch. When training with input tensors such as
                backend-native tensors, the default `None` is equal to
                the number of samples in your dataset divided by
                the batch size, or 1 if that cannot be determined. If `x` is a
                `tf.data.Dataset`, and `steps_per_epoch`
                is `None`, the epoch will run until the input dataset is
                exhausted.  When passing an infinitely repeating dataset, you
                must specify the `steps_per_epoch` argument. If
                `steps_per_epoch=-1` the training will run indefinitely with an
                infinitely repeating dataset.
            validation_steps: Only relevant if `validation_data` is provided.
                Total number of steps (batches of
                samples) to draw before stopping when performing validation
                at the end of every epoch. If `validation_steps` is `None`,
                validation will run until the `validation_data` dataset is
                exhausted. In the case of an infinitely repeated dataset, it
                will run into an infinite loop. If `validation_steps` is
                specified and only part of the dataset will be consumed, the
                evaluation will start from the beginning of the dataset at each
                epoch. This ensures that the same validation samples are used
                every time.
            validation_batch_size: Integer or `None`.
                Number of samples per validation batch.
                If unspecified, will default to `batch_size`.
                Do not specify the `validation_batch_size` if your data is in
                the form of datasets or `keras.utils.PyDataset`
                instances (since they generate batches).
            validation_freq: Only relevant if validation data is provided.
                Specifies how many training epochs to run
                before a new validation run is performed,
                e.g. `validation_freq=2` runs validation every 2 epochs.

        Unpacking behavior for iterator-like inputs:
            A common pattern is to pass an iterator like object such as a
            `tf.data.Dataset` or a `keras.utils.PyDataset` to `fit()`,
            which will in fact yield not only features (`x`)
            but optionally targets (`y`) and sample weights (`sample_weight`).
            Keras requires that the output of such iterator-likes be
            unambiguous. The iterator should return a tuple
            of length 1, 2, or 3, where the optional second and third elements
            will be used for `y` and `sample_weight` respectively.
            Any other type provided will be wrapped in
            a length-one tuple, effectively treating everything as `x`. When
            yielding dicts, they should still adhere to the top-level tuple
            structure,
            e.g. `({"x0": x0, "x1": x1}, y)`. Keras will not attempt to separate
            features, targets, and weights from the keys of a single dict.
            A notable unsupported data type is the `namedtuple`. The reason is
            that it behaves like both an ordered datatype (tuple) and a mapping
            datatype (dict). So given a namedtuple of the form:
            `namedtuple("example_tuple", ["y", "x"])`
            it is ambiguous whether to reverse the order of the elements when
            interpreting the value. Even worse is a tuple of the form:
            `namedtuple("other_tuple", ["x", "y", "z"])`
            where it is unclear if the tuple was intended to be unpacked
            into `x`, `y`, and `sample_weight` or passed through
            as a single element to `x`.

        Returns:
            A `History` object. Its `History.history` attribute is
            a record of training loss values and metrics values
            at successive epochs, as well as validation loss values
            and validation metrics values (if applicable).

        directly use `__call__()` for faster execution, e.g.,
        `model(x)`, or `model(x, training=False)` if you have layers such as
        `BatchNormalization` that behave differently during
        inference.

        Note: See [this FAQ entry](
        https://keras.io/getting_started/faq/#whats-the-difference-between-model-methods-predict-and-call)
        for more details about the difference between `Model` methods
        `predict()` and `__call__()`.

        Args:
            x: Input samples. It could be:
                - A NumPy array (or array-like), or a list of arrays
                    (in case the model has multiple inputs).
                - A tensor, or a list of tensors
                    (in case the model has multiple inputs).
                - A `tf.data.Dataset`.
                - A `keras.utils.PyDataset` instance.
            batch_size: Integer or `None`.
                Number of samples per batch.
                If unspecified, `batch_size` will default to 32.
                Do not specify the `batch_size` if your data is in the
                form of dataset, generators, or `keras.utils.PyDataset`
                instances (since they generate batches).
            verbose: `"auto"`, 0, 1, or 2. Verbosity mode.
                0 = silent, 1 = progress bar, 2 = single line.
                `"auto"` becomes 1 for most cases. Note that the progress bar
                is not particularly useful when logged to a file,
                so `verbose=2` is recommended when not running interactively
                (e.g. in a production environment). Defaults to `"auto"`.
            steps: Total number of steps (batches of samples)
                before declaring the prediction round finished.
                Ignored with the default value of `None`.
                If `x` is a `tf.data.Dataset` and `steps` is `None`,
                `predict()` will run until the input dataset is exhausted.
            callbacks: List of `keras.callbacks.Callback` instances.
                List of callbacks to apply during prediction.

        Returns:
            NumPy array(s) of predictions.
